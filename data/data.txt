It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.\n\nThis review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.\n\nMY BUILD \n\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz\nVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM\nRAM: 12 GB\nStorage: Hybrid HD-SSD\n\nAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.\n\nGRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD\n\nFrame Rate (cap): 60.\n\nV-Sync: Off. \nI rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nResolution Scaling: Low. \nThe difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49\" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. \nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nTexture Quality: 1024. \nTested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. \nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nAmbient Occlussion: Off. \nAdds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. \nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nVolume Rendering Quality: Off. \nThis is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. \nFPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.\n\nShadow Quality: Low. \nThe shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nAnti-Aliasing: Off. \nI personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. \nFPS Cost: MEDIUM\n\nLOD Bias: Low. \nThis defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM.\n\nMax LOD Level: No Limit. \nWill switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.\nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nFoliage Sway: On. \nI want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.\nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nSubsurface Scattering: On.\nI like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.\nFPS cost: LOW \n\nScreen Space Reflection: Off.\nHow objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nAnisotropic Filtering: Off.\nThe detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nWater Reflection: On.\nI honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\nSH Diffuse Quality: Low.\nThere is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM \n\nDynamic Range: 64-Bit. \nLeft on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.\nFPS: LOW\n\nZ-Prepass: On.\nI honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\n\nAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.\n\nHad already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.\n\nThe game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.\nCharacter customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)\nYou have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.\nIt has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.\nIt has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.\nIt has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.\nYou have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.\nThere's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. \nYou can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say \"finish\", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.\n\nNow, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. \nDisconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.\n\nYou will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.\n\nSome users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.\n\nSome users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.\nSpeaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.\n\nGraphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.\n\nBetter yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.\n\nSo, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 63, "recommendationid": "44077760", "timestamp_created": 1534018576, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579933586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4740, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 17728, "steamid": "76561198036329912", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1534719825, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 27, "votes_up": 1016, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920538067817687988", "review": "Ignore the connection issues negative reviews\nIt's patched now\ngame good", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 41, "recommendationid": "44784920", "timestamp_created": 1537203784, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579255798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1253, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_forever": 21748, "steamid": "76561198041108332", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1537203784, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 3, "votes_up": 370, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920192956924438477", "review": "Dont let the mixed overall reviews scare you, the game is very enjoyable in its current state.

And what I got from that, after thinking about it, was that ANY game is a repetition game. Every game out there from FPS to RPG will be the same thing over and over until you decide to stop playing it. Every Dota2 match, every CS:GO match, every PUBG matches are the SAME if you think about it. In every one of those games you get toxic or chill teammates, you get a good or a bad match, you play on the same maps with the same available characters on the current META. It's not because MHW is essentially a single player game that it's boring or scripted. It feels like the monsters are alive and thinking about their actions, due to random factors + AI it really feels like a more challenging opponent than 1v1 a human being. Honestly, I've played CS:GO, Overwatch and many other FPS all at high level and the most amazing thing about monster hunter is that ALL of those games NEVER served me with the challenge MHW does. MHW requires a lot of skill, it's mechanically challenging and the best part is that you cannot blame YOUR faults on your teammates. This game taught me to own my sh*t and learn from my mistakes.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, you should do it, and appreciate the art that this game is.

Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely engaging hunts\n+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.\n+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.\n+ Unique artstyle\n+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.\nExtremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.\n+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.\n+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.\n+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.\n+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.\n+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.\n+ The Switchaxe\n+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. \n+ You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.\n+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.\n\nCons:\n- A mediocre story.\n- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.\n- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.\n- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.\n- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it!\n-  Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times.\n- (Edit:) Co-op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in, which is just frustrating.\n\n\nIf this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game is an absolute recommend!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 16, "recommendationid": "47736695", "timestamp_created": 1545553071, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579896164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3770, "num_games_owned": 414, "playtime_forever": 19718, "steamid": "76561198052320460", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1548145730, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 21, "votes_up": 881, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894599318504333496", "review": ">Get small stick\n>Kill lizard with small stick\n>Turn lizard into medium stick\n>Kill big lizard with medium stick\n>Turn big lizard into big stick\n>Die to behemoth\n\nWould recommend 10/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1358, "recommendationid": "48355772", "timestamp_created": 1547598680, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579751112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1009, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 13707, "steamid": "76561198043676774", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1547598680, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 2, "votes_up": 195, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880150198936462402", "review": "This is my first Monster Hunter game.

It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.\n\nThis review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.\n\nMY BUILD \n\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz\nVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM\nRAM: 12 GB\nStorage: Hybrid HD-SSD\n\nAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.\n\nGRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD\n\nFrame Rate (cap): 60.\n\nV-Sync: Off. \nI rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nResolution Scaling: Low. \nThe difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49\" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. \nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nTexture Quality: 1024. \nTested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. \nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nAmbient Occlussion: Off. \nAdds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. \nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nVolume Rendering Quality: Off. \nThis is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. \nFPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.\n\nShadow Quality: Low. \nThe shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nAnti-Aliasing: Off. \nI personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. \nFPS Cost: MEDIUM\n\nLOD Bias: Low. \nThis defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM.\n\nMax LOD Level: No Limit. \nWill switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.\nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nFoliage Sway: On. \nI want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.\nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nSubsurface Scattering: On.\nI like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.\nFPS cost: LOW \n\nScreen Space Reflection: Off.\nHow objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nAnisotropic Filtering: Off.\nThe detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nWater Reflection: On.\nI honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\nSH Diffuse Quality: Low.\nThere is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM \n\nDynamic Range: 64-Bit. \nLeft on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.\nFPS: LOW\n\nZ-Prepass: On.\nI honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\n\nAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.\n\nHad already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.\n\nThe game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.\nCharacter customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)\nYou have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.\nIt has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.\nIt has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.\nIt has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.\nYou have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.\nThere's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. \nYou can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say \"finish\", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.\n\nNow, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. \nDisconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.\n\nYou will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.\n\nSome users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.\n\nSome users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.\nSpeaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.\n\nGraphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.\n\nBetter yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.\n\nSo, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 63, "recommendationid": "44077760", "timestamp_created": 1534018576, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580110415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4580, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 18364, "steamid": "76561198036329912", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1534719825, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 27, "votes_up": 1016, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920528054237365723", "review": "Ignore the connection issues negative reviews\nIt's patched now\ngame good", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 41, "recommendationid": "44784920", "timestamp_created": 1537203784, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579255798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1253, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_forever": 21748, "steamid": "76561198041108332", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1537203784, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 3, "votes_up": 370, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920163571834564209", "review": "Dont let the mixed overall reviews scare you, the game is very enjoyable in its current state.

And what I got from that, after thinking about it, was that ANY game is a repetition game. Every game out there from FPS to RPG will be the same thing over and over until you decide to stop playing it. Every Dota2 match, every CS:GO match, every PUBG matches are the SAME if you think about it. In every one of those games you get toxic or chill teammates, you get a good or a bad match, you play on the same maps with the same available characters on the current META. It's not because MHW is essentially a single player game that it's boring or scripted. It feels like the monsters are alive and thinking about their actions, due to random factors + AI it really feels like a more challenging opponent than 1v1 a human being. Honestly, I've played CS:GO, Overwatch and many other FPS all at high level and the most amazing thing about monster hunter is that ALL of those games NEVER served me with the challenge MHW does. MHW requires a lot of skill, it's mechanically challenging and the best part is that you cannot blame YOUR faults on your teammates. This game taught me to own my sh*t and learn from my mistakes.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, you should do it, and appreciate the art that this game is.

Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely engaging hunts\n+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.\n+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.\n+ Unique artstyle\n+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.\nExtremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.\n+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.\n+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.\n+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.\n+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.\n+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.\n+ The Switchaxe\n+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. \n+ You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.\n+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.\n\nCons:\n- A mediocre story.\n- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.\n- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.\n- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.\n- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor.

Steam is for some reason incorrect, it's only logged 18.1 hours as of writing this, but my actuall game log time says 32:28:35 on main + 1:03:30 for the second character I made. (That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)\n\nI am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.\n\nI'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. \n\nMy only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately.

Don't worry, it's better! You'll love it. Call me if you don't.[/b]\n\nOkay, now onto the meat and potatoes.\n\nMonster Hunter: World is a great time. Basically, you are a monster hunter from a guild of monster hunters on an expedition to a new continent when a big ol' mountain monster gets in the way and sets the stage for plot to ensue. It's not the most captivating plot, but it's got a fun, goofy, and sincere charm to it that keeps it from overstaying its welcome. You choose a weapon and get to hunting, taking on missions from the guild to take down monsters and use their bits to make better and weapons and armor that give you better stats so you can take down bigger monsters. You can also capture the monsters, which makes you feel a bit better since you don't kill the monsters, but you still get bones and stuff afterwards so someone's eventually killing that monster, apparently.\n\nCombat is fine-tuned and varied. There are tons of weapons in the game, from a sword 'n' shield to a heavy lance, to a giant sword the size of a table, to an axe that charges up and morphs into an elemental sword, to a set of bagpipes that buff your teammates and can also be used to brain monsters. The weapons all feel like they were developed and balanced with  equal care and attention, and attacks feel weighty and impactful. People draw lots of comparisons to Dark Souls, and they're mostly on the nose. Weapon swings can't be interrupted once you commit to them, but you've got more combos. You can't button-mash here and expect to come out on top. In addition, the hunts let you use traps and buffs and skills and environmental hazards that keep things fresh.\n\nWeapons and armor can be customized with charms and upgraded, and each monster has a different themed set. Stats matter, so make sure you've got good fire resistance going up against a fire-breathing monster, for example. But there are enough sets and charms to offset stats that you can absolutely lose hours playing dress-up if that's your jam (as it is mine). Also, you have a companion that goes on hunts with you, it's called a Palico, it's basically a bipedal cat, you can customize it to look like your own cat if you want, and it's wonderful.\n\nThe monsters themselves are the highlight of the game. Beautiful, fantastical designs, that go weird places but are grounded enough in reality that they look like they could exist somewhere. The cool part is that they behave like real animals - during the tracking phase of the hunt, you can just watch them as they go through the world. They interact with the smaller animals, with the plants and hazards in the world. They have territories and nests. It almost makes you feel bad for hunting them!\n\nMultiplayer is great but a little janky. Personally, I played the majority of the game solo, and had a blast. You can join your friends on missions, but the cutscenes are unskippable and if your friend is on a story mission, you have to wait until the cutscene is over to join. It's all a bit weird, but when you get going, it's a ball.\n\nThe game also has a ton of QoL improvements from the previous games - just off the top of my head, the zones are no longer broken up into areas, and you can walk while drinking potions! In previous Monster Hunter games, the levels were broken up into areas, with transition screens between them. Here, the areas are all connected, and once you load the level you're good until you go to a different level. It helps the environments feel so much bigger and less game-y.\n\nThe game is still very heavy on menus and prepping before fights. There is a hub where you replenish your inventory after each quest (you can set loadouts to speed this up now) and eat a meal for a boost. The meal is accompanied by a very fun cutscene of the Palico chef and his assistants preparing a big delicious-looking platter for you, and it's also wonderful. But, yes, the menus can be a bit much. And often right at the beginning the game can feel like it just dropped you into an ocean of menus, while you slowly drown in inventory screens. Don't panic! You can get the hang of all that later. Just focus on the hunting at first and you'll be fine.\n\nMonster Hunter: World is an absolute treasure of a game that's loaded with content. It's perfect for seven-hour binges or for one thirty-minute hunt if that's all you have time for. Gameplay is tight and varied. The whole thing is dripping with charm and polish.

But for the most part, you're gonna get people smacking you with their hunting horn and firing their bow in the wrong direction. You'll put the monster to sleep to set your barrels, just to have some guy smack you and the monster with his hammer before you can finish. You'll mount the monster, and have a guy drop a pile of rocks on you. Its REALLY a free-for-all crap-fest, so...yeah. If you want to play with randoms, just...make sure you bring your patience along. Otherwise, its definitely better to play solo or with friends.\n\nOverall I've definitely been enjoying the game so far, even with the quirks.\n\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 10, "recommendationid": "50103478", "timestamp_created": 1555127322, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580018292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1240, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 11205, "steamid": "76561198080691965", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1555127322, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 560, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851946592330932617", "review": "PROS: \n-Able to hunt monsters.\n-Able to hunt monsters with friends (when you figure out how to decently connect to other people) \n-New Gear\n-Tons of Collectables\n-14 main weapons to choose from.\n-Cool Cat who aids you.

Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn\u2019t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.\n\n[h1]Welcome, Rookies and Veterans [/h1]\nMonster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon\u2019s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. \n\n[h1]The Hunter\u2019s Story [/h1]\nThe story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it\u2019s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant \u201cHandler\u201d), and bad lips sync.\n\n[h1]Simple Hunt, Endless Approach [/h1]\nMHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it\u2019s become handy once you get used to it.\n\nThere are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce \u201cslinger\u201d as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have \u201cPalico\u201d as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.\n\nThe game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. \n\nHunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.\n\n[h1]Progress, Unlock, Enhance [/h1]\nAfter each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village \u201cAstera\u201d where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you\u2019ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you\u2019re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.\n\nOn a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.\n\n[h1]Sound of New World [/h1]\nWhile most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.\n\n[h1]Ending is just The Beginning [/h1]\nMHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You\u2019re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it\u2019s still worth even though you only play main story.\n\n[h1]Stumble in Technical Issues [/h1]\nIt\u2019s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\nMHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it\u2019s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.\n\nI hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 14, "recommendationid": "44363568", "timestamp_created": 1535178303, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 987, "num_games_owned": 525, "playtime_forever": 42847, "steamid": "76561198001490367", "num_reviews": 139}, "timestamp_updated": 1538327204, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 110, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846095383167266846", "review": "Capcom's Monster Hunter series has consistently remained one of the strongest performing staples in their roster of IPs. With its extremely wide range of visually impressive landscapes alongside its diverse stable of fantastic dragons, brutes, and other varied beasts, Monster Hunter has managed to carve out a unique niche in the currently Action RPG genre. And that's no small feat, considering the genre boasts other strong contenders like Dark Souls.\n\nThe gameplay loop of a Monster Hunter game is simple.\n- You decide that you want to make a specific piece of armor or that you want to upgrade one of your weapons.\n- You load up a quest with the specific monster that drops the resources that you need to craft said upgrades.\n- You make your way through the colorful environments, tracking the monster in question.\n- You beat the ever living fuck out of said monster.\n- ???\n- You now have a shiny piece of new armor or a fantastic new weapon.\n\nSome might feel that this sounds like a grindy, tedious experience. You wouldn't be wrong in thinking that, as grinding monsters to look for rare parts (fuck the desire sensor) can be frustrating at times. But the feeling of finally seeing the rare part that you need for an upgrade that will vastly improve your power level is exhilarating. It's so satisfying.\n\nI've been playing Monster Hunter since the original PS1 days, and every game has hooked me in to the point where I now probably have about 1,500 - 2,000 hours across the entire franchise.\n\nThat being said, I had to think long and hard about whether or not I would recommend Monster Hunter: World.\n\nCapcom has massively improved on the actual combat mechanics and added useful UI components that previous entries lacked. However, there is a noticeable lack of monsters in MHW when compared to previous installments in the genre. MHW currently feature 31 Large monsters and an additional 17 Small monsters, which is absolutely pitiful when you consider the fact that MHGenerations featured 71 Large monsters and 31 Small monsters. Fewer monsters means fewer item sets and a noticeable loss in creativity of setbuilding. One of my favorite things in Monster Hunter is the ability to tinker with mixed sets and come up with some really creative and fun builds.\n\nAt the end of the day, I settled on this: MHW is fun. Really fun. While I tapered off my playtime due to the lack of mixed set potential in the endgame, I still think that it's a game worth playing. With a new expansion in the form of Iceborne rapidly approaching (Jan 2019), MHW will continue to grow and I can only see it getting better and better as more monsters and environments are added.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "54479859", "timestamp_created": 1565066223, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580111408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6438, "num_games_owned": 797, "playtime_forever": 12703, "steamid": "76561198050006824", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1565066223, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 124, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841382145881652832", "review": "I have always been a fan of the Monster Hunter series, so I was obviously tempted to buy this game, and I was far from disappointed when playing this.\n\nPros:\n - Wonderful Graphics \u00b9\n - Thriving Multiplayer\n - Enticing Storyline\n - A Good Challenge\n - Powerful and Extensive Soundtrack \u00b2\n - Well Balanced Gear\n - Hours of Content\n - Many Different Builds for Any Playstyle\n - New Things Added All the Time\n - Easy to Learn\n\nCons:\n - Some Difficulty Spikes \u00b3\n - Failing Happens Alot \u2074\n - Connection Bugs \u2075\n\nOverall this is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the Monster Hunter franchise or just loves a good hunt.\n\n\u00b9 Requires a decent PC\n\u00b2 I don't know why but it is an oddly nostalgic OST for me and I can't seem to think why.\n\u00b3 I am looking at you, Rathians (Maybe I was just under-prepared)\n\u2074 Don't worry, it's part of the game\n\u2075 Only affects multiplayer, I haven't had this problem in a while", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 8, "recommendationid": "47956126", "timestamp_created": 1546176243, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580135196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1537, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 9698, "steamid": "76561198279474598", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1546176243, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 5, "votes_up": 163, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840692043304443359", "review": "I'm a fan of the Monster Hunter since PS2 .\n\nPros\n-Beautiful scenery and no loading screen\n-we can use the environment as our weapon\n-Turf war are a good thing, sometimes can save the day.\n-Great gameplay \n-Online with friends to get better experience (more fun and also more challange) \n\nCons\n-Design of the weapons are MEH... \n-Lack of Unique weapon design.\n-Lack of Big monster roster\n-The multiplayer Connection can become a problem.\n-There server issues that can make you rage quit.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "49922139", "timestamp_created": 1554271457, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580128502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3233, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 168443, "steamid": "76561198142006828", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1557070238, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 15, "votes_up": 525, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837588787078857422", "review": "In the beginning it wouldn't recognize my controller, however this was fixed by going to Steam>Settings>Controller>General Controller Settings and activating Xbox 360 Controller there.\n\nBerry nice game otherwise.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 37, "recommendationid": "44024172", "timestamp_created": 1533838455, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1563004216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 319, "playtime_forever": 12261, "steamid": "76561198038456274", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1533864731, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 5, "votes_up": 191, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835692524909973145", "review": "Oh man, I can't do this game justice in a steam review.

Maybe the servers seem to treat you badly but it's really not that bad compared to the sheer good the game offers. It's really not intrusive at all and you can reconnect from the main menu.

I can however, without bias, tell you that Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game made so far. From a technical, conceptual and executional standpoint. I could tell you the technicalities of the game, but everyone does that already so if you're into that then you're wasting your time reading this. This is why my first sentence is what it is. I can't do the game justice here. I've written and rewritten what I wanted this part to be many times but it's just not coming together. I can't say it easily. It can't be said easily.

Fine, ...fine.\n\nGo, and type: \"Monster Hunter Zero\" into the Youtube searchbar and watch the video from the channel: \"folga\". Even if you have the game already or have started Monster Hunting relatively recently. Done? Play this game. With friends/family if you can. Convince 'em. Did you like it? Play Iceborne when it comes. Play at least one of the previous games if you can. If there's a will, there's always a ship willing to sail you in that department. My recommendations are: Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Monster Hunter Tri and 3U separately, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. In that order and one by one if you can do all. FU&P3rd or GU if you can't. This is important: Don't rush. Did the new MH after Iceborne come out? Play it. Think you done enough? Are you satisfied? Can you swing a fish to beat up some dinosaurs with now? How about a chainsaw? Two chainsaws!? A bone? Use cats to beat up cats. Eat some Kirin Cheese. Eat some wyvern head. Shoot unlimited elemental works from a weapon no one cares about. Make the coolest looking sword straight out of Gothic 2. Or a drill from TTGL. Or beat up Gurren Lagann. Make a mix set. Make 50 mix sets. Try out a new weapon. Sharpen your weapon back up to yellow. Sharpen your hammer, sharpen your anvil, sharpen yor bagpipe, sharpen your recorder-bell, sharpen your wyvern head. Go into mud. Go into lava. Go into water. Go down into a hole. Go up a mountain. Get deep into the jungle. Lie down into sand. Listen. Catch fish. Catch bugs. Especially the Killer Beetle. No wait.. Shinig Beetle? Shine on you... Killer Queen..?? Take those sweet as.s jeans and dodge some bayblade spins and boom-booms from a living train. Get rabies. Eat a pill that gives you rabies. Curse that flying as.shole that he left the area again. Look into those blue eyes and hate them and then love them and then be annoyed and then be content. Pick up some poop, pick up some rocks, pick up some weed and shrooms to heal yourself with. Collect honey and post how many you got. Time out on trying to get specific fish. Time out trying to find a flying chode. Triple cart, quad cart! Get rocks thrown at you by a cucumber, get rocks thrown at you by a monkey, get poop thrown at you by a monkey, get snow thrown at you by a monkey, get spit on by a monkey. Get blown up and away, get poisoned and die trying to find the antidote you didn't pack. Get eviscerated, get smashed and then get smart, get fed and get your revenge. Reload your bowgun, reload your flintlock rifle, reload your armcannon, reload the siege cannon, reload your axe. Look at those ruins, so mysterious. Steal some barrels and acorn from cats. Have your pills stolen by cats. Give your cats acorns and barrels and boomerangs. You can find that tower in the jungle right? Go up to the top. Find silver and find gold. Let your gavel ring justice off ther thin tin skulls. Find speed and find serenity. Find wind, find the flames, find the mists and find a phantom lightning bolt. Find yourself in a world of poison and fire, in a world of poison and water, in a world of greenery and blood, in a world of snow and wind, in a world of the sun, moon and sands. Then you know what? Go sail a bit. Sail on the sea of sand. Marvel at the swimming mountains. Then sail on water. Ponder why it's so strange. Ponder why the story is so bad, but the lore so cool. Wonder why the sky above Schrade is always dark. Then see it yourself. Hear about it, read about it. Hear the legend and then BECOME the legend!! And then.. disappear. Sail across the sea, see the new world. Started in the new? Then you know the essence of all this is here as well. Go and see where we came from, you won't regret it.

I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. \n\nThe Pros: \n-Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. \n-14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.\n-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. \n-Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! \n-Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. \n-Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.\n-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!\n-T-Rex that breathes fire\n\nThe Meh: \n-Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.\n-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called \"Handler\" and the like. \n-No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.\n-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. \n-Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. \n\nThe Cons:\n-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! \n-The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.\n-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. \n-Denuvo\n\nIs this game worth $60 to you? Maybe not, but I had a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend at least playing through this game if you have never played a MHW game. The people who have given negative reviews are correct in that the optimization and connection issues are absolutely horrendous, but many of them also speak from the point of view of someone who has already played the PS4 version and expect better of Capcom.

The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018.\n\n[i] Pro & contra: [/i]\n\n++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts.\n\n + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.\n\n+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.\n\no Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.\n\n- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clich\u00e9d characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.\n\n- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version.\n\n[I] Summary: [/i]\n\nIt deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.\n\nRecommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish.\n\n[i] Achievements: [/i]\n\nKeep in mind that this game is a random number generated grind festival. \n\nEstimated time for 100 % completion: +200 hours\n\nSingleplayer achievements: 95\nMultiplayer achievements: 5", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 11, "recommendationid": "44469158", "timestamp_created": 1535647682, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1554734604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_forever": 19345, "steamid": "76561197968514473", "num_reviews": 67}, "timestamp_updated": 1578604488, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 147, "votes_up": 3161, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814072191715240479", "review": "Don't get me wrong, MHW is an amazing game, and this review won't affect its positive score at all, but Steam buyers deserve to know this information.\n\nPC version of the game is inferior to console one. It's no secret that Capcom hates PC audience. They love our money, but otherwise hate our guts. Not only they delayed game's major DLC for Steam and spoiled pretty much everything for desktop users (this fact alone could've been forgiven), but PC version wasn't even up to date with what consoles had right before Iceborne came out. They didn't bother bringing in missing events, crossover or otherwise (or just straight up decided not to include them, even for not console exclusive games!), neither did they updated the game with latest patch on every possible occasion.\n\nOptimisation is also lacking. Some of special effects are very CPU/GPU heavy for medium-spec parts, and Capcom, knowing their  lack of optimisation competence, didn't give us an option to go potato mode on several aspects to keep framerate from dropping. Some of in-game features (like proper transparency on camera and several others) are missing entirely from PC version.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Probably yes. Would I also recommend paying as little as possible for it? Definitely yes.

Contrary to what a select few are reporting, I'm actually able to play it (and that seems to be what the majority are experiencing) but averaging about every hour/hour and a half, the game gets an error and kicks you out. (EDIT: Since the patch, this issue appears to have completely disappeared. There may still be crashes but I can only presume they're very rare)\n\nBefore people flip their shit, the issue actually appears to be related to Steam's newest reworks to their friends system and ecetera, so you can blame Valve for trying to fix what wasn't broken, and breaking things in the process.\n\nAnyway, the game's excellent. I'm not a series veteran but I had played Monster Hunter prior to this one, and this is certainly an excellent entry into the series. Expect:\n\n-Slow but satisfying combat. While the series can be compared to something like Dark Souls' systems, don't expect to be mega-mobile 24/7, with the ability to turn on a dime and run as fast as a speeding bullet. This game's combat is, relatively to even Dark Souls II (the slowest of all the Soulsborne games), even more methodical. While some weapons like the Bow or Insect Glaive let you be pretty mobile for those who prefer that kind of style, the game will demand that if you want to do serious damage, you'll have to commit to a position and stay there. The same, however, goes for the monsters you fight, so it's not exactly unfair.\n\n-This game to be more welcoming than pretty much any other MH entry. Now, don't make assumptions: This game is complicated as all hell (what with over a decade of new iterations adding more and more features), and there WILL be mechanics that will confuse you and you'll likely resort to guides on the Internet to fully understand, but this was explicitly made to introduce Monster Hunter to people who had never played it before, and it's also certainly not a dumbed down version of previous MH games. If you can handle the complexity of, say, an MMO, you can absolutely handle Monster Hunter.\n\n-A single gameplay loop (hunting giant monsters) that the game will repeat, a lot. If you're playing Monster Hunter for the campaign, don't. This game is made for people who enjoy that formula of planning, tracking, and execution that the series has refined to a knife's edge, and most importantly, it's made for people who are interested in repeating that formula into the post-game. If you just beat games and you're done with them, MH might not be for you, I'd recommend something more singleplayer-driven. (though this game can be played singleplayer and you can still enjoy it)\n\n-Slightly less \"content\" than most other Monster Hunters, but that's probably because they strimmed down the more grindy elements. Even then, we're looking at a 30 hour campaign, a post-game that'll bump the playtime to at least 70 for anyone interested, and a core game that can entertain people for 200+ hours if the core gameplay really hooks them. If you think 30 hours for JUST the main story, in a series heavily centered around post-campaign content, AND in a game that already reduxed the core gameplay of the series into the modern era in a way that feels more smooth and polished than it's ever been, is \"not enough\", I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to tell you.\n\nOverall, a very fun entry into the series that will hopefully serve as a good introduction to those who are new.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 14, "recommendationid": "44129008", "timestamp_created": 1534198572, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9624, "num_games_owned": 226, "playtime_forever": 91925, "steamid": "76561198034740265", "num_reviews": 76}, "timestamp_updated": 1536564546, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 4, "votes_up": 61, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794236838817596436", "review": "This is my first review for a game on steam....\nI have played this game on the xbox 1 when it was out.and i will share some tips i remember..\n Tips\n#1 Some monsters you need to be aggressive with them.\n#2 Always capture them not kill them.you will get more materials from them.some can not be captured just kill.\n#3 Use the training area to practice the weapons.\n#4 Farm Farm Farm.when you are in free roam get bugs,plants,rock,and kill some monsters.\n#5 The chest on every hunt with a group Do Not Loot Every Thing.its for the whole group.if you are soloing loot every thing.\n#6 Upgrade the main weapon/armor you use the most.put gems in them also.\n#7 Them gems are rewards from the hunt or monsters.save them for the best gear.\n#8 use flash bugs and monsters deadly attacks.it will save you and the group a carting \n#9 Eat at the base when starting a mission try and get the felyne insurance.its a free life.AKA no lost life only once\n#10 On eating you can make the meals...it will require some farming but it might be a lot better then the one they give you.\n#11 This game will get you down..dark souls style send a SOS signal and get help.\n#12 Guard up and Guard is not the same.Guard up lets you tank the unblockable attacks.You might lose some health and stam but it will not kill you. works with Lance,Gunlance,and Chargeblade with the charge phials in the shield.Guard will decrease the stam/health loss on the guard.and help with knock back.\n#13 over all this game is fun.not to hard no easy just right...\n#14 Use the Bounty Board to get some hard hunts in and mats...just be at the right level and gear...\n#15 Don't be afraid to ask for help the Monster Hunter Community are the best people in the world...\n\nThis is my end of the review.if anyone has tips to help out new player post in the comments", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "55022243", "timestamp_created": 1567963458, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580088629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 10533, "steamid": "76561198833187403", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1567963458, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 94, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792960941791534424", "review": "tl;dr: skill-based grindfest that is actually hella fun.\n\n\"Didn't get that 1% gem ?

Before that, I want to tell you that I am new to Monster Hunter series and this is my first game.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nRPG , Single player , Multiplayer ( 4 players max. ) , Action so on as the tags says| Slaying Monsters | Make weapons and armor our of their bodies | Slay bigger and harder monster |Upgrade the weapons and Armor | Amazing story | A tough game | 14 types of balanced weapons | 4 Maps + 1 expansion DLC Map incoming | 40+ Monsters and more to come |Appropriate for Any age.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n\u2022 Graphics are Amazing and does run from Low end PC ( but on low settings ) as well. \n\n\u2022 You don't need to create new character and level to be support or DPS. The same character and any weapon can go however you like to. \n\n\u2022 Monsters feel realistic. They don't just fight you as AI. They have ecologies , turf wars ( fighting for ones turf ) , eating when tired or hungry so on. \n\n\u2022 Updates , DLC and collaborations constantly updated. \n\n\u2022 No Pay to win. All the DLC are costumes and visual beneficial except the expansion map incoming [ Iceborne ]\n\n\u2022 No long loading screens. They last around 2-14 seconds mostly. \n\n\u2022 Tough game but worth it and rewarding. \n\n\u2022 Even the grind doesn't bore you. \n\n\u2022 Fantastic Story and doesn't need you to play previous games to understand it.\n\n\u2022 Connection issues are fixed long time ago. Its not of an issue now.\n\n\u2022 Constant seasonal events updating. \n\n\u2022 Performance is amazing in all kinds of specs. Low mid and high. \n\n\u2022 High End PC can run High Resolution Texture pack  DLC to make it even more high quality textures.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n\u2022 Complexity & learning curve. For me the complexity and learning curve isn't very steep. But for my friends, some things seem to be hard to understand. I guess they are enjoying game too much rather than observing at least thats what they said. But in this generation everyone just googles the things that bothers them and find answers anyways. \n\n\u2022 Volumetric Rendering. This is an option in settings that boosts your performance a lot and reduces VRAM consumption by 1.2 GB. It just adds a fog that covers objects which are a little further away, most of the people don't like it as well. Especially considering that much of performance increase. Either way its your personal preference.\n\n\u2022 The game is Addictive. Seriously , I have spent a lot of time just watching at monsters mind their own business. The monsters just doesnt wait there to attack you. They in fact live like they are real living organisms. And a lot of detailed stuff.\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\n\u2022 Progress through your story (Assignment Quests) to unlock various perks. Armor Improvement , weapon Damage improvement & [spoiler] healing by hitting the monsters [/spoiler].\n\n\u2022 Herb + Phial = Potion , Potion + Honey = Mega Potion which heals you by huge amount of health. Flash bug = flash pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster face to make them blind or make flying monsters fall down. Dung = Dung pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster which you don't want to fight yet its irritating you. It will flee away by doing so. \n\n\u2022 If you hit a point where its very hard to move on , inside the quest , press escape >  fire an SOS flare. Make sure you do it within the 10 minutes of quest started. If not people who comes to help you doesnt get rewards and those who know it ( most of them ) won't join. If the time has passed away , you can return from quest ( you will have the items you farmed and used items will disappear ) or Abandon quest ( you will return to town as if you didn't even go to quest , without losing items or gaining items from quest ). \n\n\u2022 If you fire an SOS and someone comes to help you , try not to die. As there is a limit to where you can die ( 2 is normal limit and 3rd time you die, quest is failed ). They are unable to help even if they came because of quest failure. \n\n\nSo there goes my honest review about the whole game. Hope this helps you decide if you want to buy the game. And I am right now reached endgame and I am happy to help if you guys need any help. If I am not busy, I would surely help you.

I played MH3 quite extensively and loved it. I tried to get into some of the other ones but hated playing on handheld... I had this idea that MH: World was going to be very different from the other games and put off playing it for a long time, but I honestly wish I hadn't!\n\nEverything I loved from MH3 was there. It felt like everything I liked about the game but better. I feel like they just improved everything.\n\nI love the concept at its core: You hunt monsters, harvest materials and craft better gear. The gameplay is fun and you have a huge variety of weapons that each have very different playstyles, so it's grindy but it's fun to grind.\n\nThere are only a few maps. Each are pretty big, but especially rich in details and in stuff to find. Instead of having massive, empty worlds, you get very iconic zones that you learn to recognize over time. Instead of progressing through the game and forgetting \"old\" zones, you get to play in each of them for the whole game. I found myself constantly finding new shortcuts, new little hidden places with materials I hadn't seen before. It's fun even just to run around and gather stuff. If you've played any of the previous games, it's one big map now! No more transitions between zones.\n\nCrafting doesn't feel like a chore. The system is very well made and shows you dependencies when you've unlocked them and allow you to craft them first before crafting the item you want. You get plenty of \"loadouts\" or presets of items for your inventory, your equipments etc. So you waste less time managing your inventory and more time doing things that are actually fun. I think it's a great \"in-between\" having a tedious crafting system and removing it altogether.\n\nPlaying through the game, I felt like there was always something new. Whenever I thought I had finished the game, I would unlocked 30 new things, new monsters I had never seen before, new zones when I thought I had unlocked them all. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of progression.\n\nThere is always plenty of stuff to do, it's easy to set goals for yourself and even when you do run out of new content (after 100+ hours), there is still tons of things you can do.\n\nThe gameplay is hard but rewarding. You learn how the monsters move, where they go, their weak spots. A lot of it is simply knowledge. You don't necessarily need insane technical skills if you're patient and you know what you're doing. But it always gets harder...\n\nOne thing I also found interesting it's that it's one those games where everyone seems to like different weapons... I've heard from different people that different weapons were \"the best\" or \"broken/overpowered\". I think that it shows pretty good balancing in a way, when everyone feels like a different weapon is the strongest.\n\nIt's overall just a very satisfying game. It's fun, it lasts a long time and there's tons of things to do.\n\nIf I had to think of a few things I liked less... I wish I progressed \"slower\", especially in terms of armor. I found that I progressed so fast I was skipping lots of sets of armor and crafting the strongest I could instead. I think a lot of them look really cool and it makes me sort of sad I never got to wear them!\n\nI also dislike how cool sets look, when most of the time you'll have to mix and match different pieces to get the best skills, and \"layered\" armors (cosmetic overlays) are not exactly very varied.\n\nI would say that I wish there were more maps and more monsters... But there's already way more than I would expect. There's a new expansion coming too! I just hope that they will keep expanding on that game. I love being able to play on PC at last!\n\nIf it sounds like your kind of game, don't hesitate to grab it.

This review will mostly cover the PC-port related issues. I've also added some Iceborne-related info.\n\nWARNING: If you are thinking about buying this, the base game + expansion pack (aka Master Edition) is much cheaper unless you can get it for at least 75% off. So if you want to save money, you should buy that. It comes with the preorder layered armor, and you will be able to buy the Deluxe content separately later.\n\nJan 2019 update:\nPC Iceborne confirmed runs WORSE. Crashes, freezes, save corruption, anti-mod protection, anti-cheat protection. Cheaters already got past it.\n\nOct 2019 update:\nIn May, I upgraded my video card from GTX 970 to 1660ti and got a ~50+ FPS boost on the title screen, but I still got the same old ~45-50 FPS in-game, regardless of graphical settings maxed or not.\n\nDMC5's non-Denuvo version proved that Denuvo limits video card by bottlenecking the CPU (ie. the video card ends up waiting for the CPU to catch up because Denuvo is eating up CPU). Up to 20% performance difference. MHW likely has the same problem.\n\nI later upgraded to a new CPU, same video card. Now MHW runs smooth as silk. I think that confirms that Denuvo eats up way too much CPU.\n\nI'm annoyed about PC Iceborne being so late. On PS4 they've finally started dripfeeding 2 year old armors as fashion, even though it's been fully implemented since the beginning, and they know it's always been the most requested feature.\n\nIceborne is okay-ish otherwise.\n\nQuick summary:\nNot a terrible port, but has extremely terrible CPU optimization. You need a powerful video card to use the high-res texture pack, otherwise many textures are very low-res. But it's still superior to console because of higher fps, much faster loading, and mods.\n\nI can't recommend a game with major issues that shouldn't exist. I'd be annoyed if people recommended me a game and it didn't work properly. So I'm not going to do that. I paid for this game, I want them to fix it. Years later, still many unfixed issues.\n\nMajor issues (STILL relevant as of December 2019):\n- Stuttering on any kind of input. Capcom has only very recently acknowledged this and are finally looking into it. AFAIK not fixed.\n- Special K author Kaldaien says the game has worst ever CPU & Denuvo usage. Iceborne also has Denuvo. Early reviews suggest it still runs like crap because of this.\n- Blocky skin in cutscenes. This problem exists on PS4 Iceborne, too. STILL.\n- Still lacks disable bloom option.\n\nFixed issues:\n- Keyboard settings error and \"can't save game\" error occurs if you store your backup files in the same folder as the other save games. If you move them out, both problems stop.\n- You can now see friend sessions even if private, and join friend sessions easily.\n- There is now an official high resolution texture pack. Almost a year late.\n- Newer Nvidia drivers fixed the huge MHW frame drops.\n- Effect huge frame-drops fixed.\n- Online disconnection issues seemingly fixed.\n- Mouse and keyboard supported.\n- After months, they finally added disable DOF and Motion Blur. DOF is still forced on during cutscenes.\n\nUnconfirmed past issues:\n- Not sure if clientside can still cause all session players to disconnect via mods.\n- Months ago there were reports of crashes on startup caused by Steam Overlay, GeForce Exp, Ansel, Reshade. No idea if fixed.\n- Some reports of getting randomly locked out for a day after an update, due to Denuvo.\n- There were reports of the Taroth event having crash/freeze issues. Probably fixed.\n- Very, very rare bugs (sheath bug, infinite machinegun sound, cannot interact with anything and have to restart).\n- All versions of this game reportedly have a small chance of corrupting savedata or refusing to save. So you should try to backup regularly.\n\nPC port positives:\n- Loads MUCH faster than the PS4 version, even without an SSD. PS4 takes a minute or two. This loads in a few seconds, presumably if you have enough RAM.\n- Looks nice, when it runs properly.\n- Minor improvements to the GUI over the PS4 version, which were added to PS4 Iceborne.\n- Modding. Now you too can easily wear the tons of NPC-only outfits Capcom keeps making. On top of fixing tons and tons of other issues.\n- Several graphic options have a \"variable\" setting that auto-adjusts graphic options in realtime. Some are noticeable, some not so.\n- Gamepad support and key config via Steam Big Picture. I've heard there are limitations.\n- Option to configure confirmation and cancel buttons (fixes the Asia vs West button swap problem).\n\nConclusion:\nIt's pretty obvious Capcom didn't test the PC version enough. Yet they saw fit to give early access to streamers and reviewers, who (as far as i'm aware) did not seem to notice any of these significant issues. Next time, get real testers to test your game.\n\nIt took them a long time to admit to and fix many of the problems. CPU optimization (ie. Denuvo) is still so bad that it can seriously impact the frame rate. \n\nOutside of the ongoing major issues, I think you'd still need to have a clear understanding of what the Monster Hunter games are like. I get the impression many people jump into this game expecting it to be something totally different, and end up disappointed.\n\nAs a game, it feels like just barely enough content. By endgame you'll realize it's stretched thin, with heavy reliance on RNG in endgame. It's designed in such a way that you end up fighting the same few monsters over and over until you get burned out.\n\nThere are some things that are done well, and several things where it feels like they dropped the ball, or are seriously trying to troll customers by doing the opposite of what everybody wants (no joke...for example, despite players complaining about this for almost a year, they keep adding exclusive outfits and hairstyles for NPCs, despite NPCS and players sharing the same models).\n\nThat being said, if you do enjoy the core combat, then you may end up playing this for a long time. I won't go into detail about the gameplay in this review, but I will say that if you just want something to spend 30+ hours on (rough minimum time to complete story) and you don't mind RELATIVELY \"clunky\" (ie. compared to what people normally expect) high-risk controls where you cannot rely on lock-on, then you may want to give this game a try.\n\nIf you want to try it first, and maybe refund it, then be careful not to spend too much time on character creation. Just use a preset, get past the unskippable lengthy intro, and jump into training room to try out the weapons. This is a game that relies very heavily on whether you like how the weapons and combat feels. If you don't, you won't enjoy this game.\n\nAlso note that this game is easier in solo. Multiplayer has a high chance of people screwing up, resulting in quest failure. Monsters can chain multiple attacks to kill you off a single hit. This happens often when you're learning the game. You're supposed to try not to get hit. Three deaths means restarting the quest. If that sounds frustrating to you, you may want to avoid this game.\n\nPart of the fun is overcoming these challenges. Once you learn the monster patterns and how to use the weapons effectively, it can be a satisfying experience.\n\nUPDATE: Iceborne actually fixes many of these issues. Monsters are less cheap and give you more breathing space in Iceborne. So again, you should probably wait for Iceborne before buying the PC version.\n\nBy the way, I'm not a veteran of the franchise. This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've fully invested into. From what I've seen others say, compared to previous games, this one is a few steps forward (eg. much better audio/visual, easier to obtain crafting materials, weapon improvements), and a few steps back (eg. less monster variation, story/setting too \"casual\", annoying NPCs, poor fashion support, lack of things to do in endgame, reliance on limited-time events). Also, you can't do events offline, unless you mod the game.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 75, "recommendationid": "44096027", "timestamp_created": 1534083271, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9105, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 84764, "steamid": "76561198002558707", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1578733821, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1227, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750829935073852539", "review": "Negative reviews in a nutshell;\nHas Denuvo\nLack of some visual options\nConnection issues\n\nThere, I saved you 10 minutes from going through the exact same reviews.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 240, "recommendationid": "44085411", "timestamp_created": 1534050924, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1554488594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 316, "playtime_forever": 1618, "steamid": "76561198116083694", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1534050924, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748671472072601318", "review": "After playing for a decent chunk of time, there is no shadow of a doubt that this is one of Capcom's best MH titles to date. It's scenery/locations are absolutely beautiful and provides jaw dropping textures and graphical upgrades that Monster Hunter really needed (Since the 3DS quality graphics are getting quite old now :P Though MHGU is pretty good graphically wise on the switch).\n\nI've enjoyed every single second of this game and is definitely worth every single penny you invest into it, the content updates are free (Excluding some DLC's which are rightfully paid ones, not everything can be free lol). The weapons feel and play how they should, the monsters are wonderful and highly creative and the overall soundtracks to the game are perfection.\n\nHowever, I do feel as if the endgame did lack somewhat as it really didn't feel as interesting and as great as what previous titles offered (Deviants and so on). Though it's how I feel and in my opinion overall I think they should at least make some effort to improve the endgame in terms of what monsters drop streamstones and so on, grinding elder dragons all the time is getting really meh...Having that more variety with other monsters like Bazel, Jho and so on would make the grind more worth doing than just 5 elders.\n\nBut with the iceborne expansion coming it's way pretty soon I'm pretty excited what Capcom has in store for it's G-Rank tier difficulty (Not calling it master, it\u2019s always been G-Rank for me and keeping it that way).

However, these game does not utilize purely cosmetic pieces very often at all. Pieces that appear purely cosmetic often require little real work to obtain, and can even have some mechanical benefit at times.\n\nMonster Hunter is a game where you spend a little time in combat getting your a** handed to you as you learn your enemy's patterns and timing (much like Dark Souls, whose combat was inspired by the original Monster Hunter). The game also lets you play however you wish to play: do you like using environmental traps and calling local tribal peoples to your aid? spend some time discovering them all and \"contacting\" those peoples and you will have just what you wish for. Speed running is also a method of play: build armor and attachments (called decorations) to focus on the elemental damage a target is weak against, or just get your crit chance (called affinity, and ill admit this ones a weird naming choice) and crit multiplier up and wallop the beast's softer portions.\n\nThe story leaves a bit to be desired, but this is not the Monster Hunter game for a story experience. If you prefer Story, then please be patient for another release of Monster Hunter, as previous games in the series (Monster Hunter Dos and Monster Hunter 4U, to name a few) had outstanding stories and gameplay, while other games (like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate and Monster Hunter World) are more for the player experience and the devs testing out new ways for the player to enjoy hunting dangerous beasts.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "60593603", "timestamp_created": 1577366425, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579912374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 593, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 6637, "steamid": "76561198089643188", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1577366425, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 137, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738416910171508789", "review": "online works fine since latest patch", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "44347597", "timestamp_created": 1535106344, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1535635832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 13007, "steamid": "76561197967267718", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1535106344, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 156, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730321526527404785", "review": "Has many problems but still an enjoyable game whether you play solo or with friends.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "44059532", "timestamp_created": 1533962384, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1569469136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 283, "playtime_forever": 13601, "steamid": "76561198087087906", "num_reviews": 24}, "timestamp_updated": 1533962723, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728965580463409424", "review": "Fuck black diablos \n\n10/10 will get one hit killed again", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 44, "recommendationid": "55175325", "timestamp_created": 1568840938, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580058370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2397, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_forever": 28174, "steamid": "76561198068880840", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1568840938, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72792583703994751", "review": "Where should i start, well first off this was my first Monster hunter game, and i must say it was a great entry to the series.\n\nPros: \n-Over 30 large monsters to hunt / fight\n-Lots of content updates (With Icebourne coming soon)\n-14 different weapon classes and each having multiple different styles, be it looks, effects (Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, or Blast), or element (Ice, Water, Fire, Thunder, and Dragon)\n- Each weapon is viable against any monster (Although some weapons do better against certain monsters over others but that it to be expected.\n- You get a pet cat (Paleco) to fight with you\n- Hours upon hours of gameplay\n\nCons:\n-It can be a bit grindy, particularly when looking for certain item drops (Decorations, Gems or Kjarr weapons)\n-Can be overwhelming at times. if you are just starting out with the Monster Hunter series you may (Most likely you will) end up facing a \"wall\"  aka an enemy that you get stuck on but with practice you will prevail. For example, for me it was a certain desert horned foe, took me a few days before i could take him out and now can beat it in under 2 minutes!\n\nNow with Icebourne being a paid DLC, that may turn some people off from getting it as they may feel that it'll just be like other games DLC with just 1 map and a few new monsters and weapons, but I can assure you that is not the case. I personally have done a bit of research on other Monster Hunter game series and have found that in the majority of cases, the DLC or in other words the \"G-Rank\" expansions have massively increased the total roster of their respective games. For example, going from MH: Generations to MH: Generations Ultimate there was 20 new monsters added aswell and a new difficulty rating (G-rank), as the normal difficulty setting in MH are Lowrank and Highrank, and with each difficulty increase the monster get stronger, more hp and new moves. As of right now Capcom has only shown a handful of the new monsters coming to Icebourne (Although some are returning from past games) The current known monsters are, Beotodus, Banbaro, Tigrex, Nargacuga, Glavenus, and Velkhona.\n\nI'd like to close this off by saying that getting into MH: World was an amazing experience and one I wouldn't trade for anything.

It has a huge variety of monsters and armors. Boss fights are epic and intense. You can spend an hour fighting a single monster (and It's not boring, monsters switch phases, it gets angry and goes back normal then angry again then runs away from you to its nest or another place); you fight with it, then chase it, maybe he/she even will fight against another monster during this chase (and this helps your hunt. So It's a really good strategy to pull your hunt next to another monster) and finally you kill it and carve/skin it to obtain materials to craft your armor. Do the same route with another monster (and of course with same monsters to complete your set) and upgrade your gear and have more fun playing it. It has a beatiful environment design, beatiful maps. Game is not difficult to understand after spending some hours with it. There aren't any classes, there are different weapons which gives you different kind of playstyles and different combo attacks. Some of the weapons are easy some of them needs a bit more practice to understand. Monster designes are unique and fascinating. If you like Dark Souls series you will definitely love this game and its a bit harder than dark souls after you advance it in story. It gets harder and harder but It's the fun part. It's fun while you're alone and It's much easier when you're with friends and of course more fun in my opinion. \nThe things that I didn't like are few:\n1- Joining friends is really broken right now but servers are probably overloaded so It will be fixed soon I hope.\n2- We can't invite or join friends to missions from its beggining, until the cutscenes. Ok I understand that, they want us to experience cutscene story on our own but why I can't play and advance in story with my friends. We could have that choice too. You're not able to do the same quest in your questline with your friend because only the ones who completed that quest can join your hunt. I'm talking about only storyline quests because there is no limitation in casual hunts/investigations so I'm talking about co-op campaign. So they made it a bit confusing and I don't really understand it why but If some of your friends is ahead of you in story he can join and help you.\nAnd there is that. The whole game is an amazing experience for me and a huge beggining for CAPCOM to taking the good old Monster Hunter back to our lives. It's a whole different platform for them surely and It's a perfect start to begin with. This game is already one of my favourite games in all time.

Although It is better with friends, I pretty much played the game solo for 700 of the hours, since my friends stopped playing with me around the 300 hour mark, and it was still incredibly enjoyable. I've 100 percented the game's achievements, and I have also caught ALL endemic life including the Great Fishes. The only thing that awaits me now is Iceborne come January 9th, which will almost surely bring me another 1000 hours at the least.\n\nLet me say this, I am a long-time Monster Hunter Veteran who has played all previous Monster Hunter titles, and a lot of the things Veterans complain about are the dumbest things. People complain about difficulty in this game being too easy, but are blinded by nostalgia that in older games, enemy AI was about dumber than a box of rocks, and not even Terrible hit boxes could make Freedom Unites monsters harder since first of all in Unite flash bombs and shock traps/pitfalls were OP. Those items worked perfectly and the monsters did not have resistance build-up, that means every trap and bomb lasted just as long as the very first one thrown/set and these traps and flashes last WAY longer than they do in Monster Hunter World. That alone is enough to cheese 90 percent of the game barring elder dragons, who also can't be trapped. Not to mention in Freedom Unite, it doesn't matter what rank you fight the monster in, there are no variance in the move set of the monsters. its exactly the same in low rank, high rank, and g-rank in the older monster hunter games. The only thing Veterans complain about that is right is about how dangerous mobs are in the old games. The little crabs, vespoids and all dromes are incredibly annoying, and proc status way too frequently. The little crabs also have a unique move that only they have (not even the crab bosses have this move), where they move at the speed of inter-continental homing missiles to your location and smack you onto your ass, where bosses then follow up. And then there are Bullfangos........\n\nFor the most part Monster Hunter World has its fair share of difficulty just without all the bull-shit that existed in the older Monster Hunter games, and the removal of ultra aggresive mobs is quite a welcome one.\n\nCHANGE is GOOD! there are tons of new things to be excited about coming from older games. Movement while drinking potions and items are a welcome one. The ability to re-stock items from camp is also a good one. Re-newed move sets from the main series games, that offer great and enjoyable changes.\n\nAnother thing Veterans always complain about is that they want to find monsters by themselves and that the scout flies are being too hand-holdy. Ok.....hold on....so these veterans are telling me they would rather spend more time just looking FOR the monster instead of just fighting the monster???? if you know exactly where the monster is, that means you get to fight the monster faster! In Monster Hunter World monsters have several set spawn points that are spread out across a map, and *knowing* where they are immediately instead of having to run around and paintball or waste time using a Psychoserum/ waving at the airship just to find a monster is way better than the previous games.\n\nTHINGS TO NOT BE EXCITED ABOUT\n\nKUSHALA! This monster is so ass in monster hunter world, I would rather fight the Lvl 140 Guild Quest, 200% HP, Black wind Kushala from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. The normal version you fight in the story is ok, not to many problems there because you have flash bombs, but the Tempered one, and the Arch Tempered ones can suck it. The monster creates Huge Tornados on the area that it attacks you with, and not only does your framerate drop after 3 big ass tornadoes, you literally can't see shit. When the monster is almost dead it flies to its nest where if it enrages, it forms 3 BIG ASSS FKN tornadoes that along with its own tornadoes its already spamming everywhere. I literally got stuck between a wall and and 2 tornados once, and couldn't get out, pretty much just awaiting imminent death.\n\nLUNASTRA! This monsters name might as well be \"F***ing trash\" because it does damage over time, that cannot be blocked, it cannot be dodged, and it also Windpresses at the same time. Also since the Stun mechanic still exists, you will get stunned at the worst moments. Unlike Teostra it also has no tells for certain moves like its tail-swipe. It sorta just comes out of nowhere and gets you immediately. her basic attacks also leave huge areas of effect blue flames that constantly tick your HP down, and her SuperNova unlike teostra's explodes twice, and it also windpresses twice. You will find yourself doing the saving grace dive or the superman dive A ton when fighting her. Her fight is the worst fight the Monster Hunter team has ever re-designed. The only reason I've killed her so much is because her AT equipment is great for my main weapon, Gunlance at end-game.\n\nDECORATIONS, they pretty much swapped farming charms with farming decorations from previous games, and now charms are crafted while decorations are farmed for. Absolutely terrible choice, in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and 3 Ultimate, as long as you had decorations, even on bad charm tables you could make quite powerful 4-5 skill sets with the skills you wanted, but in Monster Hunter World, if you want certain skills like guard, artillery, and certain other skills, expect there to be absolutely NO variance in the equipment that you can use to fill those roles. Literally everyone has the same exact looking sets, there are no unique sets anymore since everyone needs to use the same pieces to get certain skills, and making special sets with mixed skills become even harder since certain decorations will NEVER seem to drop for you. \n\nI've done so many investigations the counter has literally stopped counting at 999 investigations. It was only much longer after reaching 999 investigations did I then get all the decorations I wanted for my sets.\n\nBut even with the terrible decoration grind, and 2 Monsters re-designed so terribly, I still love this game, they weren't enough to steer me away from how much good there is to enjoy in this game.\n\nICEBORNE IS COMING\n\nA huge number of my complaints regarding the decorations, will be fixed when Iceborne comes, and that is in the form of the new decorations. Dual skilled decorations that contain many of the essential skills that players need like artillery and guard jewels come in Iceborne and are gotten quite easilly this time around, instead of the terrible grind in Base game. Even jewels that contain critical are mixed into these dual slotted decorations can be gained quite easily just playing through Master Rank, as I have observed many players going through Iceborne's main story getting many decorations with attack jewels mixed into the dual slotted decorations from even early master rank bosses. \n\nI would rank this game as my second favorite main series game, with Monster Hunter 4 ultimate as my number one favorite game in the series.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "58708755", "timestamp_created": 1575107534, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580122280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11577, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 96710, "steamid": "76561198080583153", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1575107534, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 20, "votes_up": 412, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706781923770904541", "review": "Fun game when multiplayer is working properly.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 37, "recommendationid": "44062666", "timestamp_created": 1533975018, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1536345704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 1057, "playtime_forever": 7973, "steamid": "76561198237393466", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1533975018, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702097535133361816", "review": "Wow, what a journey!

If you were going to buy this game and play on mouse+keyboard, i cannot recommend you to do so. let me explain why:\n  The game in its essense emulates a gamepad. \nIn case of mouse it emulates right stick. The word 'emulate' is not an exaggeration. Your mouse has acceleration always on and has capped max speed. You cannot turn fast no matter how fast you move your mouse, you cannot target something precisely because inertia in emulated stick movement. it feels HORRIBLE.\n  The game has lock-on system and you switch targets with a mouse. Oookay, but do as much as lightly touch it and your screen goes all over the place, switching all the targets possible 3+ times each. Apparently developers never heard of 'dead zone'.\n   Radial menus. You think one would press Q, mouse over something and use it. Wrong! You have to use WASD to navigate radial menus, which is ... bad. At the very least it's practically impossible to drink a potion while moving. You can use F1-F4 and then 1-9 instead, but it's not very convenient (mostly due to pressing F1-F4 buttons beforehand, try pressing F1 then 7 very fast).\n   And now we get to keybindings, which are implemented horribly. Once again, emulation. If 2 actions are on same button on gamepad, they're on same button on keyboard. You cannot detach them like in other modern games. For example, on gamepad Special Attack and Interact are both on B, if i want to move Special Attack to side mouse button for example, i cannot bind interact to E separately, it moves to side mouse button as well.\n\n   Now that we're done with controls, let me also mention low graphics quality for 2018 in form of multiple low resolution textures (on max setting, mind you)  and mid 2000-s lighting. It's just not on par with other modern games.\n\n   Another weak point is multiplayer which is derived from old mobile (PSP, 3DS) ad-hoc parties. You have to join open session with up to 16 players, none of them you can see anywhere in the world, and then may form parties with them for specific quest. This design feels wrong and outdated.\n\n   Also, you cannot play co-op with your friend, because game does not allow you to join your friend on story mission you did not complete solo (or with somebody elses help) first.\n\n  All in all, the game is decent, combat is fresh and interesting, monster design (gameplay wise) is good, but overall quality of this port detracts from the experience big time. That kind of quality has no place in this day and age.

I think the series was starting to feel stale, but they changed a lot in this iteration which made for a new and refreshing experience. \nHowever, this game seems poorly optimized and while they made a lot of good changes, some are questionable. I'm also annoyed with how they changed the controllers shoulder/trigger button functionality and the lack of controllers options to fix the issue. With that in mind I just decided to play with the keyboard and mouse instead which seems to be working well enough.\n\n It feels like it lacks content compared to some of the previous entries like freedom unite and a lot of the weapons look really similar because they reused a lot of the models instead of making new ones for each path. I enjoyed this game, though I don't know if I enjoyed it much as some of the older games. I think the 2nd and 3rd generation of monster hunter may have actually been my favorite, but this one's good, especially if you're new to the series. The mechanics are explained a lot better, its much easier, has better collision, but even with those improvements its just lacking something the older games had. The monsters in this game lack variety compared to the previous games, it feels like they all share too many similar moves. I also think the movement and combat being so fluid now with the forgiving collision just takes away from really having to learn each monsters attacks, look for openings, master good positioning and timing, etc and most fights are too easy now. \n\nI don't like that the game has 2 DRMS (Steam and Denuvo), one is plenty. But at least it seems to work without an internet connection which is a big plus considering a lot of newer games don't. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIf you never played monster hunter, the gameplay is 10/10. Monster hunter has always been about the intricate combat system that rewards knowledge, creativity and skill. Combat is very similar to dark souls. If you like boss fights in games than you'll love this. Each monster has different attacks they telegraph that you have to find ways of dealing with while also looking for openings where you can get some damage in. Each monster has different strategies depending on which of the 14 weapons you use. There's a lot of replayability in trying to master fighting each monster with all the weapons types. There are also a ton of items you can use against them like traps. Winning a fight against a new monster is exhilarating, and when you get back to town you always want to rush to the smithy to see what new equipment you can make to further customize and improve your character with. It's all very enjoyable alone or with friends. \n\nCHANGES:\nMy favorite change is the visual weapon tree that shows all the branching paths so you can see what's good without having to look it up online while you play. You can also downgrade weapons which refunds your materials making the upgrade system much more forgiving. That's something I think the series needed for a long time.\nGathering is now much faster and fluid so it doesn't interrupt the pacing of game as much. \n\nThey streamlined EVERYTHING which is good and bad, but I think they went a little overboard in some areas. The new the graphical user interface is less intuitive than the old one and not as appealing. \n\nI was really skeptical about the new tracking mechanic until I fully understood it, but I think it's a good improvement over the old paintball system. They removed the loading zones between maps which changes gameplay in a few ways. The new maps are really big, complex and beautiful, but can become infuriating labyrinths at times. \nAll pieces of armor seem to give you a skill instead of points toward a skill which seems like a good change.\nCharms are no longer farmed but crafted which could also be a good change since it alleviates some of the farming and RNG. \n\nPerformance:\nI haven't experienced any crashes, but it seems poorly optimized for a AAA game. I've been playing on basically lowest settings(textures aside) and get an occasion hitch where the game freezes for a few seconds.

Having fought hacked quests for increased difficulty such as Tripple furious Rajang in an arena, amoung many others. Having loads of hours into this game as well as top 30 in speed runs for a few monsters, I can state that the game itself has allot of pros and cons to consider before purchasing \n\n- PROS\n-Quality of life changes ( gathering can be done on the run,crafting simplified, Armors not needing rare gathered items often times making no sense. Such as several rare beetles that can only be found at volcano in a single spawn on a 7% chance.)   \n^-Attacks from players no longer send you flying backwards ( gunlance shells, etc ) This allows for most diversity in the weapons that are usable online.\n^^- An interactive map that allows markers and waypoints to be set, it also shows all events in real time ( small monsters moving around, plants and gathering materials etc)\n^^^- waypoint traveling at any time not in combat on maps, as well as access to change your gear and item box during a mission, you can also eat food on a mission as well. \n\n-Smooth combat, terrain based attacks add a nice new element to the game, this often allows for interaction with the enviroment to pull attacks off that normally wouldnt be possible. For instance trapped against a wall and a monster is rushing at you? No worries, if this is one of many walls that you are able to run up, you will be able to dodge a charge from an angry diablos and turn the tables with an arial attack.\n\nAll weapons mostly viable- Despite what you will hear from allot of players, all weapons are mostly viable across the board. There are certain weapons that are niche situations however all have decent across the board balance for the most part.\n\n-All the weapons are in a single game with updated move sets, and terrain based moves.\n\n-Terrain traps are an interesting addition to the game\nwith addition of the terrain came traps, certain areas have these that can be triggered in a number of different ways, each resulting in a specific effect. \n\nCONS-\nGame based cons-\n- End game RNG grind\nHaving been a 10 year veteren of the series, I am certianly no stranger to the grind in monster hunters. However gems for your armor are now only obtainable through melding( specific low tier gems can be crafted through melding) and randomly after a mission. After hitting an HR nearing 100 and 4xx missions under my belt, I am no closer to finding any gems that I have been looking for. ( these are ofcourse among the dozens of gems that can not be crafted and only can be obtained through RNG) This RNG is further made worse by the augment system in endgame, requiring random drops from special gems specific to your weapon type.\n\n-Roar into xxx true combo\nThis is honestly the first monster hunter in which nearly every monster has a Roar into XXX move, be prepared to get that evasion + or ear plugs, as it will save you a load of frustration.\n\n-Poor hit boxes on large number of the monsters--\nMany of the monsters have rather perplexing hit boxes on their attacks. For instance often times at the tail of a rathian/rathalos durnig the standard run attack you will be hit, to the left or right of the tail slightly? -still hit - The rule of thumb is treat all monster attacks with movement as a giant cube, you will find yourself less confused and hit less often.\n\n-Monster physics?-momentum is overrated\nIn Most all of the monster hunter games, aside from X ( astalos) Monster hunter monsters were generally bound by at least their own weight class. You were able to see a heavy large monster move like it had weight to it, and its speed and acceleration would show accordingly. However that does not seem to be the case this time around in world. Many of the cast move like this was dragonball z fighters. For example, teostra has a leap in which he instantly accelerates to break neck speed from a leap nearly teleporting to a location, and seemingly stops standing like he had been there all along. This becomes rather difficult to guage the pacing of a monster when they do not abide by their own physics at random times in a fight.\n\n-Hallways and more hallways\nThe game has moved from large open areas in which to fight monsters, and instead chosen to replace it with terrain revolving around many channeled hallways. There are more open zones in the maps, however a vast majority of each map are a series of tunnels or hallways in which the fights take place. Fighting azure rath shooting fireballs down hallways is something I could do with out.\n\n-Lack of monsters move diversity-\nMost monsters share a large majority of their move set, for instance rathian/rathalos is a standard for most games, however many of those movesets such as tail spin/ tripple fireball, tripple run, are shared across a vast majority of the cast. Elder dragons all share the right and left paw swipe, amoung other moves, making it rather stale after some time.\n\n-No G rank-\nFor long time fans of the series we all know what comes with G rank, much harder monsters, larger defense values ( or Hp pools) and most of the moves 1 shot. However with this trade off comes armor that allows the highest tier of slots and skills, This allows for numerious amounts of builds and sets that would not be possible at high rank. This G rank level often times allows weapons such as hunting horn or other lower damage weapons the ability to make sets that help the weakness of low damage or other such weaknesses of weapons. The game does have a psuedo G rank option of augmentation for your armor, however it is still nothing close to the experience of true G rank.\n\n-Difficult to communicate with others\nIn past monster hunter games you could rather easily send text to other players you had on your huntercards ( friend list ) In this game however sending anything to another person is nearly impossible if you do not know them in real life. The system of simply sending them a notice or a small sentence is a thing of the past.\n\n\nNON GAME BASED CONS--\n\nDelays and more delays---\nThe PC version of this game is already vastly behind in content due to its near a year long delay compared to the console. The updates are coming in slowly, if at all. Many monsters have been pushed back months when capcom has told the community that it would be recieveing events at a faster pace than console in order to make up for lost time. The inverse it true, console is getting events at a faster pace.\n\n- Poor Online support-- ( AMENDED-ISSUE FIXED FOR MOST PLAYERS)\nFor a AAA title, having the online hosted on potatoes is unacceptable, even after the \"fix\" patch you will be hard pressed to go for any period of time with out running into errors and disconects. As it stands currently the SoS flare feature ( access to recieve help from other players during a mission) is nearly non functioning. 10 million copies sold, one can only assume that at least $500,000,000 has been made on monster hutner world. Paying a small amount of that to purhcase your own servers rather than skimp and use free hosting is unacceptable. \n\n- Lacking graphics options standard to PC games\nAs seen hundreds of times on many other reviews FOV, Advanced graphics options such as motion blur, bloom, acceleration on the mouose, ect ect should be included in a PC release. \n====UPDATED- Motion blur toggle added, Direct mouse input added.\n\n\nThe main reason for the negative review is the lacking of online, as well as graphics settings. This review will change when these issues are fixed.

I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.\n\nWhat I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :\n\n- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.\n\n- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.\n\n- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use \"SOS\" feature to help random people\n\n- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.\n\n- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.\n\n\nWhat I dissapointed from the game :\n\n- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.\n\n- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good\n\n- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. \n\n- Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customization\n\n\nMixed feeling :\n\n- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too.

I'm playing on an i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz, 32 GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti). \n\nOnline stability has vastly improved for me playing both in random online sessions, and with friends across NA and EU, since the first patch was released a couple weeks after the game's launch.

As my first MH game, even hundreds of hours into the game, I'm still finding myself learning new ways to play, whether it's figuring out a new way to use one of the 14 weapon types available, or discovering a new strategy for any of the (currently) 31+ large monsters available as hunting targets. The behavior of the monsters varies enough from hunt to hunt, and across multiple environments, to keep me on my toes when I start getting a little too cocky or comfortable. Many aspects of the game remind me a great deal of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, another Capcom game I very much enjoyed.\n\nAs the PC release of MHW catches up a bit to the content released on consoles up to now, I have plenty of confidence that my enjoyment of this game won't diminish for many hundreds of hours to come.

It's seriously a lot of fun to ignore the missions for awhile and go on \"Expeditions\", a free-roaming experience where there's no time limit and you're encountering NPCs with little quests around the area. Doing small quests gets you points and upgrade runes for your armor, too, so there's a lot of reasons to do them alongside the story. The main storyline itself seems lighthearted enough, too.

The world is engaging, watching the monsters interact with each other, fighting or hiding and all that, is very interesting.

However, sadly Capcom has seriously fucked over the PC port and they do not deserve to be rewarded for this behavior.\n\nFirst off, the game was delayed ~7 months from the console and it was reported that the delay was to make sure the port was the best port they could possibly make. That was absolutely not the case, the PC release was crippled with connection issues, mouse and keyboard issues and texture problems. Months later while the connection issues have largely been solved the PC still cannot display textures on High without mods and a number of keys cannot be rebound. \n\nHowever the biggest issue and what caused me to finally not recommend this game is content. As previously mentioned the PC port was delayed over 7 months and unlike every other game ever they decided NOT to release all of the already released content for PC and instead opted for \"accelerated release\" of that already completed content. However that accelerated release was nothing but a bait and switch. The only monster we got early compared to the console was the Deviljho, over a month ago, and since then? Nothing. They were mum on the Autumn Festival until the last minute leading many to believe we weren't even going to get it, however what we did get is a SHADOW of the amount of content the console. The PC got exactly one new quest from the event and no new monsters or events beyond. Literally the entire event can be finished in about a half hour to an hour. \n\nNow, today Capcom has revealed the PC won't be seeing Kulve Taroth, the big raid everyone's been waiting for until sometime in November. That means for another month the PC will have nothing the the base vanilla content for another month for a game that's been out for nearly a year. Absolutely unacceptable. \n\nThe game is a total blast and I've loved all my hours in it but I cannot honestly recommend this game given Capcoms handling of the PC. We're missing so much content, our holiday event is neutered and there are still numerous bugs romaing freely.

Mastery is the most rewarding aspect of Monster Hunter - as you gradually get better, so too will the success of your hunts go.\n\nAsides from hunting monsters, there are many other activities in MHW to keep you busy - finding ingredients for the canteen, collecting and catching native wildlife, befriending the local tribes of humanoid cats, gathering resources, and fishing. Most of these activies will also help you in your hunts in some way so it doesn't feel like a waste of time when you do them.\n\nThe game is tons of fun playing with friends online, and playing with randoms is also very easy as you can join anyone that fired an SOS flare (or fire one yourself). Playing solo is also an option and the whole game can be soloed.\n\n[b]Overall - I highly recommend this game to action RPG fans that enjoy challenging combat and deep gameplay systems.[/b]", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46500546", "timestamp_created": 1542941597, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6390, "num_games_owned": 1275, "playtime_forever": 41342, "steamid": "76561198043810317", "num_reviews": 29}, "timestamp_updated": 1545978788, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64286273717880249", "review": "i got a pretty hat n thats what matters", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 21, "recommendationid": "55919891", "timestamp_created": 1572477628, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579660840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 410, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 1963, "steamid": "76561198165756482", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1572477628, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642287313938140869", "review": "Good Co-Op game.

Some monsters are unfairly punishing in the sense that if you get stunned you can just be locked in tot he point that you're just dead, but it's a double edged sword.

Then we released it without the dlc updates available on consoles not to mention the servers and terrible optimization.\nCapcom manager: no problem I have a plan to fix this. Let's use the money from PC sales to make events exclusive to consoles.\nCapcom staff: FACEPALMS\n\nEDIT:\nSeems like a few fanyboys have misunderstood the context of my review.So to avoid any further misunderstandings let me explain why I've given it a DO NOT recommend.\n\nFirstly let me say that i am a big fan of the game and the series and it's not my first monster hunter game but i'm not going to ignore some of the issues I faced during my 300 hour playtime.\n\nIf you played the game at launch then you will be familiar with the error code 50382-MW1. Want to play with a friend? sorry get disconnected.Want to help a someone through SOS?nope sorry MW1 incoming, want to play alone? guess what? it's your buddy 50382-MW1.Such a big issue should've been fixed within the first week itself but it took Capcom 3-4 weeks to patch this.This is the main reason why the game has lot of negetive reviews.\n\nThat said,they HAVE FIXED the issue and there's no complaints on my side regarding server issues anymore. So if you're considerding not buying the game cause of server issues then let me tell you they HAVE BEEN resolved.On the same note you can ignore the reviews complainting about mouse issues as well.They HAVE also been RESOLVED.So if you like the base game(killing the sht out of monsters) and were on the fence of buying cause of these 2 issues.Then you can safely jump over the damn fence and get game already cause the issues have been resolved.\n\nSo why did i give this game a thumbs down??\nHere are my reasons\n1.can't join quest until host has watched cutscene(WTF??)\n2.Horrible keyboard+mouse optimization.\n3.Graphics performance. It's looks worse than Witcher3 and yet does not run as well as the Witcher3 which was a 2015 game btw.\n4.Events and updates not included. There is no reason why they shouldn't have included all the patches of consoles in the PC version upon release.\n\nI don't believe that the developers should go without criticism when they take 7 months to \"optimize\" a game and yet release it with such glaring issues.If no one complainted about the servers then we probably wouldn't have got a patch in 3 weeks(which itself is a long time).Similary I believe if no one complaints about the events and additional content they are going to take longer than we hope to see new content being released.\n\nOnce we start catching up to the consoles.I will change my review to recommended.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 178, "recommendationid": "44869409", "timestamp_created": 1537611772, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1560377089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 35714, "steamid": "76561198072858081", "num_reviews": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1538072835, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636363625526428223", "review": "As a monster hunter veteran and someone that helped many get into the series, I can\u2019t recommend this game enough. It is my game of the year for sure. I played the Xbox version for over 500 hours (nearly 100 %ed it) and looking to do the same with this one. Even after doing pretty much all this game has to offer I will still play it. I already have way more friends to play with now that it is on PC, and that\u2019s great!\n\nIf you know nothing about Monster Hunter it is essentially a game where you hunt monsters. Constant mini raid bosses that can take up to 50 minutes sometimes. The leveling up in this game just unlocks more quests, not stats! It is long endurance fight for parts to make a variety of weapons and armors. It honestly makes the grind fun. Even though you are hunting for all these parts the game is essentially relying on your skill. A skilled player can beat this whole game without wearing a single piece of armor. The armor is just to make things interesting with the combination of skills you can come up with to customize your playstyle. The game rewards using items to make fights easier and almost feels like you are planning a hunt any time you come across a new monster. Each monster has unique strategies to learn and plan for. The game rewards reaction time and learning the movement of the monster like real hunting as well.\n\nEveryone is welcome here and it is awesome! If you are new to Monster Hunter this is the one to get into! The game is much easier to learn and get used to. Older Monster Hunter games took like 20 hours before you go \u201coh yeah I got it\u201d. This took about 4 or so from what I seen with the newcomers I tagged along with.  If you are a veteran of Monster Hunter you will most likely love it if you can accept change to a more modern game. I still go back to old ones and play them for that unique experience but this game is so worth it! There seems to be a split in games now, which is totally awesome in my opinion. Old school vs new school. This monster hunter is the modern new school and if you are old school you can fit right in as one of the cool kids. \n\nBefore you buy you have to remember some things. The beginning will seem overwhelming if you never played a Monster Hunter, but if you stick with it you will find a great game I feel. Each weapon has a learning curve, some easier than others. But each with a depth to be found and enjoyed. Most weapons are super unique and change the way you play the game completely so if you aren\u2019t enjoying one, try another. The game can be soloed (I soloed or did duos with one friend most of my first time through the game), but it is so much better with friends. The online community for Monster Hunter has always been welcoming so if you don\u2019t want to solo you can easily find a group willing to do hunts with you. Since I am a bitter old man I only like to hunt with my friends. I will solo before joining randoms. Some quests have to be started solo and if you are playing with friends, that can be annoying. Once the cutscene is triggered it its joinable though. So just have your friends back out and join you or vise versa. Other then that just take your time with it and learn the game at your own pace!\n\nNow if you own the PS4 or Xbox version and want to double dip like myself I highly suggest it. I was blown away in the first few minutes of this game. The game looks gorgeous. I played on an original Xbox One and the graphics were acceptable (Monster Hunter has never been about the graphics so I didn\u2019t mind) but oh my god. It\u2019s like receiving a random nude from your crush at 4 in the morning when I opened this up. It\u2019s beautiful. I may get ripped a new one here but frame rate as long as it\u2019s higher than 30 doesn\u2019t ruin a game for me. As long as it\u2019s fun it rarely bothers me. But the uncapped frame rate here is just like taking my favorite dessert and saying \u201cHEY NO CALORIES WITH THAT BAD BOY, EAT UP!\u201d. I also have way more friends to play with on PC cause a majority of them have PC\u2019s over consoles. So, if you have few good people you want to make a hunting party with then go for it!\n\nLike I said this is my favorite game of 2018 and its going to take a miracle of a game to beat this for me. I gladly will buy this game twice\u2026 which I did just to experience it with a PC coat of paint and more friends. \n\nTLDR: interested in it? give it a shot. It has a learning curve but not as bad as previous installments. Owned it on consoles? Buy it again anyway cause this game is a great PC port.\nA veteran afraid of \u201cnew\u201d MH? I was willing to accept the modern twist on it. The old ones will always be there to experience again.\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44029149", "timestamp_created": 1533852453, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1547794691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 387, "playtime_forever": 2632, "steamid": "76561198071634049", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1533852453, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635996103286743164", "review": "2004-2009\n[i]guy buys PS2 to play Monster Hunter 1-2G[/i]\n2010-2014\n[i]Guy buys PSP to play Monster Hunter P3[/i]\n2015-2017\n[i]guy buys 3DS to play Monster Hunter 4-XX [/i] [spoiler], gets rekt by lv140 Rajang [/spoiler]\n2018-present\n[i] guy builds NASA computer to play mhw [/i] [spoiler],computer turns into scrap metal from Teostra blast[/spoiler]", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 86, "recommendationid": "49257197", "timestamp_created": 1551243754, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1565018153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 14604, "steamid": "76561198296357290", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1551243754, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 98, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630659222602844238", "review": "This game should actually have overwhelmingly positive reviews that is a typo.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 16, "recommendationid": "49631124", "timestamp_created": 1552916522, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580028504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2002, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 13084, "steamid": "76561198059599499", "num_reviews": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1552916522, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630130946636199951", "review": "Nvm, games fixed.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45093453", "timestamp_created": 1538620213, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580112110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4827, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 37249, "steamid": "76561198043749913", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1561774148, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629629611968994141", "review": "Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter is a series I recently got into. It's quite an action packed series and this game lives up to it for sure. You can expect big monsters, big weapons and quite the challenge. This game is the newest in the series and is getting a new dlc very soon. This dlc will add a bunch of things to the main game and from what I've seen on ps4, is really darn good. So there will probably a lot of you wondering if you should get into this series. And I'll tell you right away, that if you like action games and monsters. Then this is the game for you, but in world, the developers also added a whole world for you to explore. There are several maps where you can discover different ecosystems, from small creatures to the big ones you're actually fighting. This game keeps you excited throughout the game and made me scream in joy when beating some of the bosses. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into the series as well, this is probably the easiest game to get into from the series since it's more user friendly than the old games. Now I'll rate some aspects of the game.\n\nGraphics, the graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. (10/10)\nStory, I don't think the story is anything to brag about, it could've been a lot better. (7/10)\nGameplay, there are tons of weapons to choose from and monsters to fight. (10/10)\nMaps, the maps in this game are quite complex and detailed but don't go expecting too many maps. (9/10)\nMusic, the music in this game is really good, also the in-game sounds really work well to improve the overall experience of the game. (10/10)\nBugs, haven't had any issues myself except for bad connection with friends a few times.\nDuration, the duration of the game really just depends on you. I got about 140 hours out of the base game, but some of my friends got way more (or way less.) \n\nOverall this is an easy 9/10 for me. Especially with the new dlc coming up, this game and the dlc will be 60$ together which is a really good price for what you're getting. \n\nThere is one thing you should take note of however. You have to grind a lot, like a lot. These boss fights are really hard for the average person, I managed myself but if you're having trouble you'll have to grind to get new gear. But you shouldn't have to worry about grinding too much in the main story, however post-game you'll have to start doing some grinding. \n\nI hope this review helped you out on your purchase, if you have any questions or want to share with me what you thought about the game, then feel free to dm me about it!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "52874589", "timestamp_created": 1561991598, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6015, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 14505, "steamid": "76561198164001436", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1578328814, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62881237268447876", "review": "It's gorgeous - I can only run it on low settings because I don't have enough VRAM for more, and it's still beautiful.

Everything from MHW's core mechanics to its sound design is nothing short of triple-A quality. \n\n This game is an absolute joyride and while it definitely isn't perfect; you should sleep in peace knowing that Capcom actually understands how a $60 game should be made.  This is one for the history books.\n\nI'll only be addressing the gameplay section since it's the only part where I feel as though quality has any dipping.\n\n[h1]Gameplay 10/10, somewhat of an acquired taste, but savoury nonetheless[/h1]\nMonster Hunter: World remains faithful to the franchise as it focuses on the thrill of the hunt, making tweaks to keep the game's mechanics both fresh yet strikingly familiar to returning players.  For new players, the game's well-paced campaign ensures that first-time hunters do not fall behind the learning curve.\n\nMonster Hunter: World shatters the norm by giving each of its weapon sets entirely different and unique mechanics, which, coupled with near-perfect balancing, allows all weapons to be effective and viable.  Players are given a plethora of weapon choices from the get-go as well, allowing them to explore the playstyle which suits them the most.  As such, the core combat mechanics of MHW, though deceptively may seem very similar to games such as [i]Dark Souls[/i], actually finds similarities with a slew of other games such as Devil May Cry.  \n\nIn the five-course-meal of a game, however, the combat itself is just the dessert.  Monster Hunter: World brings the thrill of the hunt to a new level with sprawling maps and biomes--each with their own fitting wildlife.  Expect to trek through sludge, toxic gases, or cross gaps swinging along a vine as you track your target with the help of your scoutflies, passing other monsters along the way as you follow the food chain up.  The game feels exactly as advertised, with your surroundings dynamically changing with the fight and monsters interacting with each other: a true spectacle to behold.  Only hunters who successfully track down their target and make full use of their items and skills can take down a monster after 20-to-30 minutes of fighting, having to track it back to its nest where it retreats upon realising it is no longer the king of the jungle.\n\nThe condiments to this delicious meal are the way Capcom designed MHW's gearing system.  Hunting gear is forged using materials gained from skinning kills, meaning the more you kill, the better chance you'll have at taking down the next biggest thing in the jungle.  There are just enough required materials to make the grind for the materials needed for the upgrades a challenge, without making it feel like a painful, boring grind such as with cases like Diablo 3 where a player could spend hours accomplishing nothing.  Instead, MHW ensures that the player makes steady, but slow progress with the eventual promise of good loot, as opposed to the blind gamble of most grind-for-gear, dungeon crawlers currently in the gaming industry.\n\nOverall, Monster Hunter: World proves that despite having a rough couple of years, Capcom still has its touch and is a breath of fresh air.  Despite it being a port, the game runs without much worry, though I would still recommend a beefier setup (follow the game's recommended system specs, perhaps) to get the most enjoyment out of it.\n\n\n[h1]Multiplayer 6/10, doesn't really work...literally.  Though it is amazing when it does.[/h1]\nAlas, nothing is perfect, and we finally have to address the game's shortcomings, which come in the form of its highly unstable servers and confusing multiplayer design choices.   Make no mistake, Monster Hunter: World is absolutely not an MMO, but rather, a very well-balanced multiplayer experience which does not intrude with the player's experience, unlike how Dark Souls' instantly makes the game a cakewalk.  Instead, the issues like in Capcom's decision to make connecting to multiplayer both frustratingly difficult and infuriatingly unstable.  Not only do online sessions drop out quite often, the game confusingly requires players to put down everything they've already set in motion in order to connect to an Online Session.   I find it frustrating to always be shown the error message notifying that I no longer have the ability to send out SOS flares to call for aid so other players in the session can help when I'm about to get knocked around until the next time I visit the hub world--ostensibly entailing that I'll have to completely drop the hunt if I hope to get any hunting companions. \n\nPlease, Capcom, the game is damn near perfect.  Fix the servers and everything will be well on its way to being flawless.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, the game is a stunning visual and mechanical masterpiece.  Monster Hunter: World boasts a game of legendary quality truly worth every cent and more of your precious money.  Yes, it's expensive, but for $60 you get an incredibly crafted world with detailed animations and design, and a living, breathing jungle filled with bigger and bigger monsters to hunt and kill as you climb your way up the food chain to become an apex predator yourself.  \n\nI have never recommended a game in a Steam review more than this.

First off this is a time consuming game, and expect to spend at least a hundred hours into for endgame / true ending. If you play games mostly for the stories and not its gameplay, than this game isn't for you. The game is graphically incredible; the armour, weapons, monsters, characters are all beautiful. MonsterHunterWorld has addicting game-play with a well implemented crafting system. Your character progression is achieved through your own ability getting better, learning the monsters, and upgrading your gear. This all makes for a very rewarding experience. The endless number of collectibles, and the complexity and strategy around how to attack the monsters , and presents an engaging challenge. The game is content packed and also has frequent updates and free DLC.\n\nI was hesitant to buy the game at first, there is quite a bit of negative press for it. A lot of issues with connectivity and fps. And now the connectivity issues are largely fixed. The gameworld is rich, with a intense level of detail right down to ants sometimes walking around - there are many item sets to collect, many weapons to master and enough content to keep everyone happy, whether you prefer playing solo and co-op, there is something for you here. The game is absolutely worth every penny. I recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure game, play with friends, build a guild or join one, and share your adventure to the world, these will double the fun and increased the value of the game by ten folds. There's a reason it's sold as many units as it has, and that's because it deserves it. It's not a perfect game, but it's the best in it's series in almost every way, that's exciting. I've never played a Monster Hunter game before, but I'm glad I picked this up. If you are on the fence about this one - buy it! You will not regret it.

Pretty much every quest in this is a boss fight and there's not much variety other than that - that's what the series is about. The problem is that the game can feel highly repetitive and even exhausting (if you aren't quite as skilled) that makes it difficult to enjoy. Its end game is essentially made up of farming the same monsters over and over again for a chance to drop rare streamstones that you need for augmenting your gear - and the worst part of it is the RNG.\n\nThis is a great title and it was fun for me initially. However, the fun factor drastically went down as I progress towards end game. Halfway through this game, I've already found it to be a chore - perhaps it's my own pacing of the game.

Just saying though, the game is in a far better shape than it was at the time of writing this review, so crank the score up a notch!\n\nAs an absolute MH fan this game is a blast, finally seeing some quality visuals. As someone who is discovering the series ? It's probably a good starting point, definitely the most accessible title of the MH franchise so far. Objectively speaking though, it suffers from quite a few issues. I'll list both pros and cons below in no particular order :\n\nPros :\n+ Gorgeous graphics, the most obvious one (just compare to older titles and the upcoming MHGU which was the latest entry in Japan before MHW)\n+ Easy to pick up and play, the convulated systems of the previous games are much more simple now, and everything is explained.\n+ Training grounds to try your weapons on a static dummy.\n+ Ability to revert some weapon upgrades (as well as getting the materials refunded)\n+ This one is subjective, but I love the verticality and complexity of the maps in this game.\n+ Slinger and specialized tools are nice additions and don't feel gimmicky in that they have actual, consistent uses.\n+ Very short loading times (in comparison to stock consoles). My game is installed on a SSD and I have 4 ~ 5s loading screens.\n+ Ability to see the entire upgrade tree of any weapon instead of resorting to 3rd party resources such as Kiranico or the MH Wiki\n+ Quick access items / Inventory wheel. Beats having to scroll through your entire list of consumables before finding the right item any day mid-quest.\n+ In the same vein, a lot of information was made readily available in-game, although a lot of it is still vague (but at least it's there). It's more than enough information for the casual player to soak in and make educated decisions.\n+ Most weapons have revamped, more practical and streamlined movesets.\n+ More tasks to do in-between quests, more rewarding systems, etc...\n+ Expeditions (free play in the maps of your choice, no time and death limits)\n+ No more needs for consumable tools to collect stuff, and collecting and carving in general is much smoother (also hooray for invincibility + super armor carving at the end of a quest)\n+ Some more details that'll speak more to veteran players than newcomers\n\nCons :\n- Connectivity issues, the most obvious one. Despite having (at the time of writing) 62 hours logged into the game and greatly enjoying it so far, I have without exaggerating spent 7 to 8 hours trying to join friends' sessions (or them join mine) and abandonning quests midway because someone disconnected.\n- Menus. I find they're a massive cluster**** for a reason I can't fathom. This however might be because I'm very used to the old games' menus, which were very similar to each other and have changed very little over time.\n- Performance issues. Although my PC can run the game just fine thanks to my specs (above recommended), there were niche instances where everything would stutter or the frames drop. This has only happened during the last Kushala phase with its tornadoes and tempest weather. Might have happened a couple times during VFX-heavy moments where 4 players and the monster would use their flashy moves at the same time.\n- No one uses the gathering hub (multiplayer hub where you see other players before questing). You can do everything from Astera's lower levels directly and don't need to access the hub to host and start multiplayer quests.\n- I'm nitpicking on this one but I find it annoying to spawn at the front Astera gate after a quest. I'd rather spawn at the 1F elevator so that I can skip running through the first floor to get to the canteen, or otherwise still have the same distance to run to the 1F NPCs if I have business with them.\n- Why is the Handler so derpy...\n- Multiplayers slots remain filled when someone leaves mid-quest or get disconnected so you can't ever have a full party anymore during the remainder of the quest if that happens. Super annoying with the recurrent connectivity issues.\n- Game is easy in comparison to older games. Also indirectly related to the fact that there is currently no G Rank.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd say the game is great. A lot of the needlessly complex systems are much simpler now or have been straight up removed, The game simply suffers from a few - but glaring - issues that must not be overlooked by Capcom. The thing is, as it stands, a unpolished gem and I sincerely hope the game gets fixed sooner rather than later, both to save face towards the new players and making the experience as close to flawless as possible.\n\nAs for whether I recommend it, I think I've successfully made 20+ people that were on the fence about getting it, buy it, and so far no regrets.\n\nArbitrary score : 7/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44161020", "timestamp_created": 1534323100, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3016, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 28464, "steamid": "76561198026654468", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1578306118, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60000002384185791", "review": "[h1]Explore a beautiful new world, study the magnificent creatures that live there, and cut them down for a new hat for your cat.

This is just me writing a review with my current thoughts and opinions for this game. I love this game! And as much as I want to recommend it to someone, it isn't a game for everybody. So I guess I'll start with my pros and cons? \nMonster Hunter always had a variety of weapon choices and each one of them has their own unique playstyles. When I get bored of one weapon, I would spice it up by using another. The game has great graphics and most importantly multiplayer! Even if multiplayer isn't a big selling point for you, single player can still be fun and challenging. You can always try to beat your best time/record by learning the monster or \"cheesing\" it. Comparing Monster Hunter World(MHW) to other monster hunter games, MHW has so much quality of life. For me this is a game changer because everything is so easy to organize/manage.\nNow then to what I don't like! Its really hard to play multiplayer as a new player. I think this is my biggest turn off starting the game. I would be unable to play multiplayer if I have not seen the \"cutscene\". The storyline of MHW feels like a tutorial than a story and it honestly sucks. Once you completed the story, its a grind fest.(I enjoy this but others may not) You grind to power up yourself so you can kill monsters easier is the gist of it? This game is also easier compared to the other monster hunter games and I think its because they are targeting a new player base. \nMHW does have plenty of mods that can step up its quality of game. If you like to be a fashion hunter, there are mods that makes you look super spicy! With that being said this is just a summary of my summary. I hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I do!

R1 fires and R2 runs.  Additionally, practically [b]all the buttons have additional functionality[/b], some which seems random at times, especially in menus and with certain weapon types.  It's [i]very[/i] hard to keep track of.\n\nIt is utterly asinine if you've played most action RPGs that exist. The controls are uncomfortable, confusing, and we have to deal with it because for some godforsaken reason they couldn't add gamepad remapping, be it ingame or via Steam.\n\n-- [b]Button prompts are for Xbox controllers.[/b] Dualshock users are shafted.\nEdit: [url=https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-world-pc-ot-now-jaggi-free.60725/page-21#post-11334316]Mod fix[/url] It was already in the game files and the Steam API presented the controller to the game.

Way better map control than gamepad.\n\nKeyboard control is sub-par, notably in menus, but otherwise usable. Expect to rebind stuff though.\n- There's no way to slowly walk with keyboard.\n-- Certain keys cannot be bound.\nCamera control keys hardcoded to OKL; and cannot be changed.\n\n\nOverall, it feels like a console game in design through and through.  Repeated \"saving don't turn off the game\" messages, menus are clunky with KB/M and take far too long to do anything, etc. You can't even exit the options menu without it prompting you to save, even if nothing changed, and if you decline it's just an endless loop.  It takes a goddamn minute to get to the main menu.\n\n[b]Low-res textures on numerous assets[/b].  Some textures are LOWER QUALITY than the console version, presumably due to a bug. [url=https://i.imgur.com/HOxzL6D.jpg]Example[/url], [url=https://i.imgur.com/BCCv32d.jpg]Example 2[/url] This was discovered a month before launch and still isn't fixed.\n\n[b]No way to disable depth of field (or motion blur)[/b].   It's [b]extremely[/b] aggressive and 70% of the screen is regularly blurred in cutscenes.  Even opening your map the entire screen is blurred: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1472048946\n- Denuvo is blocking attempts to disable DoF and Motion Blur.  #DRM\n\nFXAA and TAA only.  Both blur the screen to ludicrous levels and barely help the aliasing.  (Yet again another game that lacks the superior SMAA)\n\nAmbient Occlusion is low quality and produces a grid-like pattern on character models.  This is ugly and nothing can be done to remedy it besides turning off AO, ruining the shadowing.\n\nPerformance is very poor for the 1:1 port this is. Volumetric fog chunks framerate by 20%, ontop of making everything look washed out.  Best to disable it both for performance and image quality (in most areas).  On a weaker system?  You're gonna struggle.\n\n- Water reflections only change the color of water in certain lighting and cause immense draw call increases, disable them too.\n\n- Screen Space Reflections are broken and do nothing but lower framerate, again disable them too.\n\n- Anisotropic filtering is broken and does nothing, must force from GPU drivers.\n\n- Load times are based on framerate.  Running at a high framerate significantly lowers load times.  RIP Vsync users (which should be everyone, because tearing is terrible).\n\n- Elemental effects on attacks cause stuttering and massive frame drops.  Someone could be on the complete opposite side of the map as you but your game is constantly stuttering every time they hit something.

Just wtf?\n-- Lobby system is also terrible. Squads use Steam Groups, not anything ingame.  You can only see other players in the 'gathering hub', an area almost no one goes to.  There's a max of 16 people in one 'lobby' at a time, and most only have 1-3 people with only ~15 lobbies displayed in the lobby finder at a time.\n--- There are endless connection issues from the game servers being overloaded.  It's been over a week and all Capcom has said was \"we're working on it\".  Multiplayer is effectively broken. Edit: Patch 2 weeks later only fixed people disconnecting mid mission; still numerous issues.\n\nItem saving system is convoluted as hell and your item bar/wheels are saved to specific loadouts. The game never tells you this.\n\nMonster parts are listed as being separate for 'carve' and 'reward' options.  The 'carve' parts can all be obtained from rewards, misleading players into thinking they have to kill/carve the monster to obtain them (vs capturing).\n\n\n[i]Supposedly we have an older build of the game compared to consoles.

Local area man wanders into an island with his bi-pedal cat pal and smacks down monsters to wear them and use their skin and bones to defeat even bigger tougher monsters. And so the cycle continues until eventually monsters that used to take you 30 minutes to kill now take a mere 5 minutes. It's a journey of growth and self improvement and there is no greater satisfaction than when everything clicks and you're able to conquer old foes. \n\nIt's pretty much a game of nonstop boss fights with some farming and gathering on the side (note there are literal farms you can utilize to reduce the gathering needed) as well as a dress up sim with your cat and character which you use the parts of the monsters you've hunted to craft youself new gear.\n\nI love this game so much that I previously owned it on PS4 and decided to buy it again for PC to play with friends and experience better load times, etc. At launch there were definitely issues with connection but I have not experienced disconnects in a long while now. Maybe it is different for other players.\n\nLoad times are nearly non-existant. I have already surpassed my PS4 save (I stopped before Devil Jho came out in anticipation of replaying on PC) with less hours played! It's amazing. The world is so beautiful and this is truly Monster Hunter at its prime. I went to play Generations Ultimate for the classic MH expereince again (I played MH3U and MH4U in the past) after World and the quality of life (QoL) differences were astounding. I missed World immediately. Faster gathering, infinite whetstone and gathering tools, one giant field map instead of zones with loading screens, etc.  I'd say the only real downgrades are less monsters and not being able to play as your Palico - boo! The new monsters are pretty awesome but I do miss the likes of Zinogre, Brachydios, Tigrex and more.\n\nOh, also being forced to play the story again is kind of annoying. Cutscenes really should be skippable in 2018, come on Capcom. The way online is handled for story mode is also rather stupid. If you want to play with a friend you have to each start the mission separately, watch the cutscene, then one leaves and joins the other. However this was a design decision on the Ps4 version as well, equally dumb then. Once you complete the story its not really an issue anymore and MH Vets like to say the story is the tutorial and the real game starts after. Not wrong, really!\n\nAfter the story is completed the world is your oyster really in how you choose to spend your time. Grind for those decorations and augment stones to spoof up your builds and imrpove your kill times, help out others in any ranks, take on tempered monsters,  raise your rank, play with friends, take on the arenas and challenges, and my personal favorite -- experiment with new weapons and builds with all the excess materials gathered!\n\nMost people associate PC with hackers; I have only seen one hacker so far and he was harmless - a HR198 yet clearly had not yet beaten the story (only had one tool) and he just hung around the session. The hacker problem isn't really as rampant as one might think and a majority of people want to play the game legit.\n\nOverall, if you never played a Monster Hunter game before but have been interested this is the best one to get into thanks to all the QoL changes introduced. And if you played already on console or classic titles I'd still recommend this if have a friend group to play with or would like to meet a new community of hunters.\n\n10 outta 10 Palicoes recommend the game.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44556252", "timestamp_created": 1536007089, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580113700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6994, "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_forever": 26147, "steamid": "76561198062206693", "num_reviews": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1536034060, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 107, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590981483459472656", "review": "Game is enjoyable except for the fact that the online multiplayer is inconsistent as all crap, and disconnects are very frequent, making playing with friends very frustrating", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 25, "recommendationid": "53276460", "timestamp_created": 1562119790, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580093841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5302, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 28462, "steamid": "76561198106137825", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1562119790, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590301036834716797", "review": "I knew my 2011-spec PC wouldn't run any more than 20 fps, but I bought it anyway.

You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big-ass monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).\n\nThe servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo.

Did they succeed? Somewhat. The recent popularity of similar games such as the Souls series did well to get people into the mindset for the genre, and the changes made to the series with World were an additional step in the right direction to get more people invested into the franchise. Now, more people than ever are playing Monster Hunter, and the series is doing well for it overall! However, the game is not perfect; it stumbles in a few areas.\n\nAs Monster Hunter moved into its now \"fifth generation\" of the series, it's made some significant departures from some longstanding traditions. The archaic point threshold armor skill system was replaced by a more streamlined incremental skill system that makes more sense; an overall positive for the series that promotes more build variety. The change from segmented hunting areas to a seamless single area with no loading zones changes the tempo of the hunt dynamic dramatically, and greatly enhances immersion. Things are much more vertical now, and the addition of the slinger, a grappling hook/slingshot combination, is a great move. Other quality of life improvements such as the SOS system or eating food during a hunt are also a great benefit. Some might scoff at these improvements with \"back in my day\" comments, but honestly, things are a lot better now.\n\nThe core of the game, combat, is better than ever. Each weapon is streamlined and smoothed out to feel great. While some weapons are naturally going to be more popular than others, they're all equally viable from early game to end game. If you want to main a weapon type, or be a generalist, you are always free to do so without any feelings of missing out. The verticality and environmental hazards of the areas also greatly enhance the hunt. No longer are you just fighting in \"zone 3\" with flat ground and dull scenery; every part of the hunting zones in World feels like a living ecosystem, with things to help or hinder you as you see fit.\n\nOverall, the game is great, and will carry a player for a hundred hours plus, easily. However, things are not all well. The early parts of the game force you to experience the story, and you can't do so in multiplayer; other players cannot join the hunt until everyone else has seen the same cutscene. If you're playing along with friends, this results in an awkward situation where everyone all starts the same mission solo, sees the cutscene, then everyone leaves their quest to join in on one player. It's an awful mess that critically messes up the multiplayer experience for the early game. In addition, you can't see other players in the same hub unless you're in a specific area of the town, but that area doesn't have access to the farm, the ship, the armory, or anything else critical to preparing for a hunt; people often just never go there, so even though you're often in a hub with up to 15 other players, you're not seeing them. Another unfortunate thing is that once you know what you're doing, the game is much easier solo; so except for a few specific situations, you're better off hunting alone anyway.\n\nGiven that this is a new generation of the series, it's inevitable that the game has relatively few monsters compared to older generations. While it's satisfactory for the game itself, veterans of the series might be dissapointed with small variety of monsters given the huge amount we've had access to in previous games. New monsters will come in time, as Capcom is constantly working to give out free updates.\n\nThe last major problem with Monster Hunter World is that the end game can be a bit underwhelming. Once you get over the novelty of fighting tempered elder dragons, you suddenly find out that grinding them is pretty much all there is left to do. Sure, there's a few distractions like Kulve Taroth events, but the majority of end-game is fighting the same four to five monsters over and over again for low chance RNG drops. Older games in the series handled this better.\n\nAll in all, Monster Hunter World is a great game with a few minor gripes. After all, if you get 100+ hours out of it, can you really complain? I only put up the demerits above because I love the game so much and want to see it improve, and I know it will. Capcom's been releasing patches over the past few months, fixing the problems people have had with the game.

As the pc version just released yesterday I played for like 2.5 hours though spent most of the time creating the character. So here's a short review of the game (PC VER.).\n\n\u03c1\u0550\u053e\u054f:\n\n\u2022 Pc port performance is quite good.\n\u2022 Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay.\n\u2022 Beautiful and varied world with so much varieties.\n\u2022 Each monster is different and requires knowledge about the monster to actually beat it in the proper way this gives a feel of a boss fight every time.\n\u2022 Story is moderately good and engaging. \n\u2022 The dense wildlife sounds are so good and many monsters can be identified through their cries, footsteps, and other audio intels.\n\u2022 Combat is great controls might need some tweaking but it's great and weapon types and list is massive and diverse.\n\u2022 Tons of customization also character creation is quite good. \n\u2022 Environmental hazards are something you always have to be careful about as nature can ruin your day beside monsters.\n\u2022 Food cooked by cat chefs what more do you want man :p\n\n\u03c2\u0e4f\u0e20\u0e23::\n\n\u2022 Troublesome design with forced online interactivity.\n\u2022 lip sync is totally crap.\n\u2022 Multiplayer matches can be fiddly to set up.\n\u2022 The new verticality of levels occasionally leads to frustrating AI pathing glitches.\n\u2022 Denuvo DRM I simply can never make myself to like it.\n\u2022 Some notable problems [Motion Blur Depth of Field Bloom/Glow Effects Mouse Acceleration] no way to turn them off needs fixing.\n\u2022 Might face problem with controllers.\n\nIn the End this game is a must buy for playing coops because coop is the heart of this game.

I can for sure tell you that Capcom has definitely fixed a lot of quality of life issues with World for the better. That being said, and especially with Iceborne around the corner, there are some glaring issues that are massively holding World back from feeling like an authentic Monster Hunter experience. The largest issue World has right now, in my opinion, is the slap on, sorry excuse for half the weapons in the game.\n\nIn previous titles, if a monster had a weapon in every weapon category, EVERY single one of those weapons would be a unique model that felt like it was actually crafted from the materials used to create it. Unlike in World, where we see scraps of the monster that you hunt poorly glued on to the hilt of any old boring bone or iron starter weapon. This is especially criminal when you've hunted an elder dragon, only to discover its weapons are pieces of the monster in question glued on to a bone greatsword. Not to even mention the existing designs for older monsters such as Barroth that have no excuse to not retain their old weapon designs, I'm looking at you Glavenous Greatsword...Considering Capcom has sold more than 7 million copies, this is completely inexcusable. Being able to hunt monsters and make sweet equipment out of them is a fundamental element and source of rewarding progression in the entire franchise. \n\nMy only other gripe is that the game still does not provide a single-player option when trying to just solo. It feels very awkward, especially if you mostly play solo like myself. This is a feature that would be extremely easy to implement and it's just a shame that this has not happened yet.\n\nI know this post may seem nit-picky, but for someone who is very passionate about this franchise I've been playing for a decade, it's just extremely frustrating knowing that one of the main motivations and rewards for hunting a monster in the first place is lost. If this is your first Monster Hunter game, I would urge you to look at the old weapon designs for even something like Barroth, and come back when you see how well implemented and original the designs used to be.\n\nI understand that this is a process that takes time and effort, but I feel Capcom has more than enough recourses to fix this easily. Its something that has been done in every single MH game before World. Don't settle for less, fight for more.\n\nedit: what i meant by the offline, is that there is no existing option when your selecting your character to go into an offline mode. and the only reason i thumbed down this game is because i am disappointed with Capcoms lack of focus on what i feel is a core reward for MH games. When i was messing around with the end game of non icebourne content, i felt like i didnt have that grocery list of things i wanted to do like i had in other games from the series.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 51, "recommendationid": "60331188", "timestamp_created": 1577035215, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1577461089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 15087, "steamid": "76561198170093590", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1578010957, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580407261848449707", "review": "Love is like Monster Hunter World,\nsometimes the game can get frustrating, \nsometimes you are 3seconds away from getting A in an arena quest,\nsometimes you have unwanted guest barging into your life,\nsometimes you disconnect,\nsometimes things can get difficult and painful,\nsometimes its microwaved food,\n\nThen again, you learn to appreciate from time to time,\nyou learn to just sit down and listen,\nyou learn to just understand and explore,\nyou learn to be forgiving,\nyou stand up and try again,\nyou learn to see the little things that you love,\nyou learn to go a little bit further to get some extra fancy clothing for your loved ones,\n\nand then you remember why exactly you fall in love for the first place again.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 59, "recommendationid": "44075474", "timestamp_created": 1534011110, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1569688873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 21634, "steamid": "76561198070633964", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1535686074, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580323457717895508", "review": "This is my first Monster Hunter game and I have to say that I am hooked, this game delievers a tones of fun, scalable difficulty, tones of hours of regular storyline and sideline questing, and I can recommend it highly.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47706580", "timestamp_created": 1545482790, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1564038076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 26877, "steamid": "76561198103050998", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1545482790, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580152630805969238", "review": "So it's finally here,  the very first Monster Hunter game to make its way to the PC. Funny enough, it's the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. so you can count on me being unbiased and judging the game based on its own merits, instead of other games in the series. as with all of my reviews, I will be reviewing the game based on sound, graphics, and gameplay in its own category. This game has been played and reviewed using a Xbox One wired controller. Unfortunate to say I have not tried the keyboard and mouse.\n\nSOUND:  The Games soundtrack consists of various themes based on the location you happen to be in, as well as personal themes for each monster you fight. Each one does its best to make it memorable, but I feel sometimes it just doesn't hit the right kind of vibe with me. just do what I do, when you happen to get tired of listening to the music. turn on some personal music of yours, and fight the monster with your own interpretation. as for the sounds of everything else, the monsters sound absolutely frightening, as they should. The Ambiance does just what it needs to do to put you in the mood to go around and look for footprints and other such things as you Traverse around.\n\nGRAPHICS: many of the environments that you will be exploring are vibrant and wonderful to look at. from the beach to the crystals of Elders recess, to the graveyard of the rotten Vale, every place you visit will Often be a spectacle. You will definitely be happy to explore as Not one place is similar to the other. Not only this, but the monsters themselves are detailed very well, having fluid animations when they ready up to attack you with all sorts of different Elemental attacks. you will even be happy to take note of your armor, each one varying with a theme of the monster that you find In each tree. Expect to be dazzled with each encounter, as each one is more structurally complex than the next. of course not every monster is going to be easy for you to see from the backdrop, one in particular, which is a dragon made entirely of metal, can be hard to see Pieces of it falling off for you to collect. Luckily, they do have options for those color blind so do not worry. They thought of us.\n\nGAMEPLAY: the most important element, next to the video element in any game, is the game play. And I can honestly say that it's probably one of my favorite types of gameplay. one might think that monster hunter would be similar to Dark Souls in that you take turns Circling each other and striking when the time is right, dodging enemy fire with the Press of a button. I can tell you right here that it's probably even more complex then what Dark Souls had in mind. there are a variety of weapons from the sword and shield, to a heavy bowgun that will take some time to get used to, but is often rewarding with How heavy the combat feels. long-range weapons often have a special ability that you can activate by pressing a button, from turning your gun to essentially a sniper rifle, or a Mini gun that can produce a great amount of damage. melee weapons, like swords and axes are based on different types of combos you can Use to produce a great amount of damage. with these kind of weapons if you're doing good enough, you can essentially break off pieces of the monster, resulting in them greatly losing the effectiveness of a certain attack, or opening themselves up to even more damage of a particular type. my personal favorite so far happens to be a mix between the heavy bowgun, And the sword and shield. while it is generally a good idea to be familiar with a  specific weapon in mind, it's even more beneficial to familiarize yourself with Two or more different weapons. Not only does it spice up the gameplay a bit for you, but it is also a necessity as certain monsters are more vulnerable to certain Styles.\n\nYou start the Monster hunting by eating food, which can be done by visiting the canteen either in town, or at the table When you first arrive in an area. Eating food will boost your health, stamina, and will often benefit you with various timed abilities that will help you depending on the play style that you choose. upon reaching an area, your goal  is to track the monster described in your mission, find it, and often hunt it down or capture it with a variety of different Traps at your disposal. This often means finding Footprints, scrapes on the ground, bits and pieces of the monster, or even animal corpses left from there snacking for you to find where they are on the map. Upon finding said monster, you must do as much damage as possible, and while it is much more rewarding money wise to take a monster out yourself, the game really shines when you have friends or random invites join your game to take down a monster with you. often times I find myself with a variety of different people, with a different weapon that they often use to make difficult encounters just slightly easier. upon killing a monster, you can carve them to get a little extra pieces for that special helmet you wanted, upon completing a mission, you will be rewarded not only money, but points that you can add to your total depending on how many items you have found and collected, as well as how many tracks you discovered, and they will be necessary for you to have as they can also be used as money in certain areas around the Hub world, but also they might be the only thing that the NPC you're talking to will accept. For such an example, botany Will be a major role in your Hub world as you can grow things that you find yourself not collecting as often as you need. such items are usually mixed to create new items like potions and damage Buffs that you will absolutely need in order to take down a particularly hard monster.\n\n Monster hunting is the name of the game, and while other people that are spoiled rotten in other games such as Skyrim might not look at this game as rewarding just by slaughtering monsters But they are doing themselves a huge disservice. and while most people would consider this game a real-time RPG, it's definitely Much more complex than that.\n\nOVERALL:  if you're looking for a game that rewards you for learning your weapon, and a fun multiplayer game with your friends that are into role-playing games, This is the game for you.

After a while my friend just bought the game for me. \n\nBasically: Super fun.\n\nThe game is kind of slow to start. The first hour or so is pretty cutscene heavy and feels very hand holdy, but it picks up. I'll be honest, the actual story is pretty meh, but all the story is anyways is a fat tutorial so... yeah. Gameplay is this games strength though. I think the easiest way to explain it is that every fight is a boss fight (minus killing the pesky smaller mobs of course).\n\n Some monsters are really easy to fight, especially if you're padded with the right armor. Later on you might as well be wearing paper, you'll get punished for not knowing fights/not knowing when to hit and when to dodge/block. The community is pretty friendly for the most part, there's some people who get salty at higher ranked things but that's kind of unavoidable. \n\nPlaying with other players is really fun, but do your best to know as much as you can about the weapon you're using and the monster you're fighting and what you should bring. You don't wanna be the guy who uses the last of the groups carts (respawns). For learning a monster I'd recommend just soloing it and playing evasive while you learn all of its abilities/tells. For learning your weapon, I'd probably just look up a youtube video. I recommend Arekkz, he has fairly quick tutorials for every weapon and it'll really help speed up the learning process for your weapon. Oh and as far as I know the textures for pc are still bugged, so even on high settings you'll only get the lowest textures. Just look around on Nexus for the high res work around.\n\nOh and you should send your guild card to people you group with and take guild cards from everyone that sends them to you. It's not a friend request or anything, you get to see their hunter stats n poses n stuff, but the real benefit to this is that you're letting hunters use your palico and getting more palicos to use for yourself in tailraider safaris. Those'll open up towards the end of the story.\n\nTL;DR\nGreat fun, nice community, do your part/be as learned as you can and you'll be fine. Textures are buggy, just check the nexus for a fix.

So what I expected was that Capcom would release the content that has already been seen on the Consoles with the PC port, but nope.

First id like to say for those who dont want to read an essay, this game got an undeserved bad rep. I mean sure the game has issues but they arent ones that justify it being given a 45% total score. So let me just address the issues really quick, or at least the ones I know of that have impacted me. In the first week of release the multiplayer of this game was horrific, I mean seriously. You would queue up a quest with your friends, get about 5 minutes in and then be disconnected. The way the game works it also meant that even if your friends did disconnect, although the match wouldnt end and you would all be against the monster in your own solo missions, the monster would retain its multiplayer difficulty level and still does to this day. This means that when the multiplayer crashes, for the most part the mission is unplayable. Other issues I encountered was just how much CPU this game eats up. Like seriously, what is it doing? Its running at 97% CPU and sometimes during the handler cooking cutscene it makes my pc grind down to the point where it seems like its dying. These however are my only issues with the game, and the multiplayer has dramatically improved, however still not amazing its at least playable 90% of the time and im sure with consistent fixes it will become 100%. The CPU issue, im no computer scientist but im sure they can patch the game or do something to optimise it so it doesnt eat such an ungodly amount of CPU. Now to the positives, and they really are positive. This game is beyond refreshing to me, this game has and will continue to provide me with hours of amazing entertainment. The satisfaction levels on this game are the highest ive ever felt playing a game, whether its beating a boss by the skin of your teeth in the early game, to grinding and farming rare item drops to try and take on the tougher end game tempered bosses, the progression of this game is superb, you overcome mountains each day and consistently improve. The weapon choice is amazing, you can play the hard hitting mass damage greatsword with a slow and devastating play style, or you can go rapid damage dual blades, even using my personal favourite the insect glaive where you can do all sorts of acrobatics around the monster applying debuffs or explosive clouds. The combat truely is wonderful, there are so many different weapons and thanks to the jewels and skills there are so many ways to play these weapons which means you can play a bit of everything and mix things up so you never feel bored. In terms of monsters, yes i would like a greater variation many monsters are very similar and there are far too many damn flying monsters for my liking and yes I would love some more balancing as although there are so many armour sets, in the end game stage really only a handfull are actually viable, id love for them to be a bit more balanced and be able to run these obscure pieces without getting smashed because theyre so low defense. I think they really need to release the DLC asap to bring it to the same level as the console version as Im incredibly jealous of the console gamers having behemoth and kulve but the game hasnt been out long so i can only hope it does come out and soon enough. I think the reason this game got so badly recieved is because people just took it at face value, we had to wait 8 months for what is essentially a vanilla port that on release had a host of issues so people just took straight to steam to leave bad reviews, if people actually took a step back and played the game as it improved and gave it a chance then they would see that actually this game is incredible and without a doubt my favourite release in the last 5 years at least.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44440276", "timestamp_created": 1535535140, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579959299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 595, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 23721, "steamid": "76561198006973800", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1535535140, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571873366832733154", "review": "Better with friends", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46136878", "timestamp_created": 1542856328, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579111329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 327, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 16122, "steamid": "76561198043067191", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1542856328, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571799337863922119", "review": "Network issues and missing content aside, this game is phenominal.

The game was developed and published by Capcom. Monster Hunter was released in North America on September 21, 2004.

The majority of the content is in the online section of the game. Only some monsters are found in single-player and the player's rewards are smaller (and less valuable) when they are offline.

The Graphics are not the best, but amazing enough to give you this experience that you are walking on a living breathing land. Talking about living and breathing, the monsters are absolutely spectacular, this game has you thinking, calculating and observing what the monster does next and countering it with your own attacks, The designs are well done and amazing and the cutscenes perfectly reflect their role and power in the region they thrive and live in.\n\nThe regions are extremely well done and the monsters that live in their respective regions make sense as to why they live in those places. My personal favorite Region is the Coral Highlands, the fact that Highlands are sustained by the life energy of monsters that die in the Rotten Vale gives me this feeling that i am walking over a land that is ACTUALLY living!\n\nThe Story of MHW wasn't a top for me even though i am one massive lore nerd as it was pretty blank in concept, the story missions were basically the same thing copy-pasted with a different monster. From the first mission your objective is to kill some Jagras, your second mission is to kill some Kestodon, then the third mission is to kill a Great Jagras, then the Fourth mission is to hunt a Kulu-Ya-Ku, it's the same thing over and over with some in-between stuff like the Pink Rathian trail things and all that, but the cutscenes compensate for the lack of a story in my opinion.\n\n[b] I know this review isn't going all that in-depth about the game, but i tried to rush this out as fast as possible cause i just couldn't hold it back to write my kind of Love letter to Capcom about a game that snagged me in  and wouldn't let go just as i won't let it go now.\t[/b]\n\n[b] 9/10\t[/b]", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47553061", "timestamp_created": 1544903053, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580065051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4012, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 62959, "steamid": "76561198167137401", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1544903123, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57124406099319458", "review": "Nice game, but cutscene handling is annoying :C", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "48129213", "timestamp_created": 1546716288, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580077002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5271, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 23602, "steamid": "76561198052220672", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1546716288, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571228682994842529", "review": "The new patch completely screwed over keyboard users by changing all hotkeys with no option to roll back.

What does this mean? It is a [b]\"painfully pleasant grind\"[/b], like the one Warframe lovers experience (here you don't have a foundry with timer, but a macho smithy). Do you need equipment? Hunt for it. Can't hunt the monster you need? Hunt another to get better gear and then hunt what you need.\n\nPlayers will complain about [b] difficulty [/b] and endless [b] grinding [/b], but hey, that's what the game is about, if you make every single dragon an easy fight and make all your needed gems 100% drop chance, you will have everything in no time and uninstall it in 3 hours or refund.\n\nGet this game only if [b] you do not mind the grind and can tolerate frustration[/b]. The monsters will kill you, they will roar in the middle of your godly combo, they will hit you with the last pixel of their tail when you have 1hp. [b] All this is part of the game [/b].\n\nI absolutely do not recommend this game to the \"button smasher\" type of player. Want a hack 'n' slash full of combos? Go play Bayonetta or something similar, here you will get punished if you attack nonstop.\n\n[h1] Random Thoughts [/h1]\n\nOnline:\nThe first day I couldn't play online at all, now I haven't experienced a communication error in days, they are fixing stuff fast.\n\nHackers:\nThey exist, but you rarely or never see them online and they cannot give you any benefits. If you try to hack you just kill your gameplay, don't do it, it will be like hackers in Dark Souls, full of items and nothing to do.\n\nRNG:\nDecent, you have ways to get stuff, most of them include killing monsters. Example: \"I need this tier 8 gem that will never come out from the melder (it is the grandma with the cauldron that resembles a gem gacha)\"; Good news! There are some missions that will have higher chances of giving you the gem, so you have 0.81% instead of 0.27% chance of getting it! [b] There are lots of gems so expect those percentages for getting the super ultra godly rare tier 8 you want [/b] (you will get them eventually).\n\nWhining:\nMany people do it, don't listen to them, if they whine 24/7 it is because they are the type of player that shouldn't have gotten this game.\n\nPrice:\nCould be lower, it is a good game where you shouldn't regret getting it full price anyways (if this game fits you of course).\n\nGameplay:\nGOOD! But! I really suggest playing with controller, best recommendation 10/10 fav +1 rep like sub. It is playable with keyboard and mouse, but you will have a \"full experience\" with controller (Radial menu can be changed to keyboard and mouse just in case, read the first tab of your menu.......).\n\nPeople:\nIf you really want to enjoy the online play: 1) Play with your friends! [strike] (ha ha)[/strike] 2) If no friends, join a MHW PC discord, there are lots with friendly people willing to help or struggle with you.[strike] and you don't need friends for those ;_;[/strike]\n\n[h1] TLDR; [/h1] [b] Get it![/b] specially if you like/tolerate grinding, it is a good game that will be getting better over time.

You fight these large or small monsters with your own skill and intelligence of your items, environments and monster's info. You can go with a squad of 4-player, or alone. You can even SOS if you can't hunt the monster on your own. The game is best played multiplayer.  The game is great for single-player as well. Graphics is amazing even in low quality. Good gameplay every single time you went out to hunt. On the downside, the game is grindy for the certain materials you need.\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nThe game's title speaks for itself. A monster hunting game. The story is mediocre but the focus isn't about the story. It's in the gameplay. Monster Hunter is a game about being a hunter fighting a large monster. Hunter Vs Monster. Every single monster is unique and their mechanics is based on what the monster is. Every monster is born with unique traits. If it has horns, it will try to impale you. If it has poisonous claws, it will try to scratch and poison you. \n\n Every hunter will pick one of the weapons. Every weapon is also unique to their own with their own set of moves and special abilities. Mastering a weapon is not as easy, but every weapon will reveal itself, the way of the blades, to you. The map is an immersive layered floor with each map is different. There's no single map like each other. You, as the hunter, will have to adapt and learn the environment and use it to fight. Either in your favor, or against you. You'll have to think things through to fight and take down the beasts.\n\n You fight these monsters either alone, or with a squad of 4-players. The monster will be stronger on multiplayer. Providing challenge to the players hunting it. Your squad will have to cooperate and fight the monsters. Positioning, items and weapon capabilities will play parts in your gameplay in hunting the monsters. Since all weapons are unique to their own, it's not difficult to give them room to play well.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44475259", "timestamp_created": 1535669290, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580074046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 39724, "steamid": "76561198139863111", "num_reviews": 38}, "timestamp_updated": 1578492831, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569992303848266602", "review": "Punched a frog in the face... got paralyzed.\n\nI already love this game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "44034687", "timestamp_created": 1533874319, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1534186145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 400, "playtime_forever": 1376, "steamid": "76561197966099173", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1533874319, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569976568222045898", "review": "8/18/2018.

When relaunching the game there was an error message:\n\nFailed to load save data.\nRevert save data to default?\n[Yes] [No]\n\nClicking No over and over again just repeated the same error message. However after clicking Yes in order to continue I was mad to discover that all my progress so far has gone down the drain and now I have to restart from scratch including re-doing the painstaking character creation and re-watching the unskippable cut scenes - Groundhog Day style. It makes me cringe thinking that if I ever want to continue playing this game then I will have to restart from the beginning - I get that I have only played 17 hours which is small fry compared to other players who have lost their character progress after 50 hours or so, but still, 17 hours is a lot considering all the other AAA games out there that I could have completed in less than half the time.\n\nWhat kind of game in this day and age can't even get the fundamentals right? I have played many games from many genres over the years, and something as common as a crash to desktop has never required me to start from scratch due to corrupt saved data...until now. If this game is so vulnerable to saved data corruption, then the developers need to allow multiple save slots per character so that if your most recent save file gets corrupted then at least you can load an older save file and recover most of your progress. But this game is intent on putting all your eggs in one basket which is never a good idea for a game designed to take most players between 40 and 50 hours just to finish the story mode.\n\nThis game is already a grindfest to begin with, but the allure of fighting new unique monsters and the journey of building up my character's weapons and armor in preparation for the final boss kept me going. However, until the developers fix this issue, I'm not willing to spend another hour on this monster of a game (pun intended) with the horrible idea lurking in the back of my mind that another crash might mean bye-bye to my character.\n\n**EDIT**\nI appreciate all the helpful comments here especially the one with a link on how to quickly back up the saved data using a script.

You hunt, you grow, you hunt bigger things, and you find the focus of the game: hunting. The game focuses on the hunting experience, and everything is built around it. You craft better armor and better weapons to get hit by giant monsters, and hit them better. You collect food and meds to support your hitting, and being hit, of giant monsters better. \n\nAnd that is were I suggest were people really think if they would enjoy the game. Do you like hunting? If yes, ask if you would like hunting very big things? If yes again, would you hunt things that would make your caveman ancestor proud inbetween his screams of terror? If yes, then you would likely like this game.\n\nNow here is the part were I post things that you should watch out for so you know about it ahead of time. There will be grind, but if you like hunting, then all grind is reduced to just collecting meds to keep hitting the monsters you like hitting.\nYou will have a wealth of choices, and some time will be wasted on \"Will I hunt X thing now? Or Y thing? Oh hey Z thing popped up?! Do I pick that?\"\nAnd lastly, you will curse your luck on rewards. You will love and hate gems before you even find out what they are. You will hate how you get one item in midgame you will love, and be told you have a chance of picking up more, only to never get one 200 more hours in, and your friends will say \"Oh my five Xes? I just got lucky.\" while they envy you for the Y rare thing you picked up they need but you don't.\nAlso if you main a weapon that isn't ranged, you will fear the mating call of air raid sirens that have become locked onto your butt.

If you've got time to spare and want an exciting and immersive game to invest yourself in, Monster Hunter World is definitely worth it!\n\nCan't wait for Iceborne!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46208233", "timestamp_created": 1542874806, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580121933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2333, "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 37635, "steamid": "76561198081719868", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1575317732, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 2, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "review": "[b][h1]\"The Best Disconnect Simulator in the history of games.\" 10/10 -IGN[/h1][/b]\n[b][h1]\"The Biggest Middle Finger to Online Gameplay in history.\" -Rotten Tomatoes[/h1][/b]\n[b][h1]\"The Best Way To Play Monster Hunter Alone.\" 5/7 -Capcom[/h1][/b]\n\n\nYou bought this game to play with your friends?

They are not wrong. The connection issue is real. I hate it too. but the game is still pretty good if you like this kind of game. and it will be even better if the connection issue get fixed.\n\nMonster Hunter World is my First entry to this series. For similiar game i've played probably just Toukiden2.\nGameplay involve Hunting Monsters in the New World (duh) where you have to track and research the Monsters.\nThere will be a lot of tracking Gathering Crafting Cooking Eating Building Character and Fighting.\n\nthe Game is okay. i don't find any major bug (but there are lots of insects).\nthe Graphics looks beautiful and run pretty well on my Ryzen5 + GTX970 got 50-60fps (60 on most places) Setting most graphic options rendering on Mid. except Textures on Full (still looks pretty low but i don't mind. they probably looks like this on consoles too)\n\nHighly Recommend when there is no network error.

I have finished both story arcs at the time of this writing (80 hours of play in). I may update this review if/when I reach HR100 for the final cutscene.\n\nFirst of all, why I recommend this game for new prospective buyers:\n-Fast, intense combat mechanics\n-Careful gameplay is rewarded; mindless spamming of the attack key will get you killed\n-Comparisons may be drawn to Souls-like games, Souls fans will appreciate MH\n-MHW is the most acessible MH in the series (with the exception of MH Generations, which is reasonably accessible but is only availble on 3DS and Switch at the moment)\n-The graphics are the best of any MH game, and are beautiful in their own right\n\nHowever, there are people who refuse to think strategically, who want scripted setpieces, and linear corridors. If this is you, this game is not for you.\n\nNow, here's my analysis of MHW as a MH veteran:\n-Amount of content is lower than other MH games. This is a big deal. It took me 80 hours to complete both story arcs; it took me ~120 hours to get to this point in MH4U on the 3DS.\n-Easier matchmaking than any of the past MH games. I have to stress that MHW's multiplayer worked absolutely fine for the first two days; I firmly believed that Steam updated its multiplayer API and that is what caused all the connections issues\n-Certain mechanics have been massively simplified and are objectively easier than previous games\n\nAn explanation of the last point:\n-Most item crafting has been made mind-bogglingly easy. All crafting has 100% chance of success. Potions and Cold Drinks only require one ingredient. Tranq bombs are now made with only two ingredients. \n-Mining and gathering points respawn over time, meaning you'll never actually run out of resources mid-hunt.\n-Palico Abilities are incredibly useful, and can be requested on demand.\n-Palicoes basically never die. When they faint, it's for a matter of mere seconds.\n-Free traps exist throughout the map.\n-Potions can be consumed on the move, which makes the game unbelievably easy for many monsters. (For people who say that you move too slowly while drinking potions for it to make a difference, you obviously haven't tried sprinting while drinking a potion.)\n-Scoutflies have replaced Psychoserum and Paintball\n-Many items that had to be manually thrown (without any form of aim assist) are now fired by a slingshot that has autoaim, such as stones, dung bombs, flash bombs, sound bombs.\n-You can fast travel all over the place\n-You can equip an item that literally makes you invulnerable (or another item that makes you invisible)\n-You can withdraw items from your item box mid-hunt if you need to restock your items.\n-Unlimited Whetstones.\n-Monster carves, mining/bone materials, and account items go straight to your item box, negating the need for inventory management\n\nWhat does this mean for us? Gone are the days where we would meticulously plan our items in a perfect balance of utility and leaving free space for gathering. Gone are the days where if we ran out of potions, we had to scavenge raw materials from herbs and mushrooms and honey from certain gathering points to make more. We can literally just leave combat, fast travel back to camp, pull potions out of your item box, and go back to the fight. There's no more danger. There's no more careful map knowledge needed. There's no fear that once you have picked the land clean of the mushrooms and herbs, that you would no longer have any more materials, since they respawn anyway. There's no getting around it: MHW is easier than any other Monster Hunter before it.\n\nOne could argue that they are simply quality-of-life changes. I'm ambivalent. I don't think they're good/bad since they have both their drawbacks and their benefits. I'm glad that Capcom wants to innovate rather than keep everything the same (like some certain titles and series). It's one of the few ways to make a game fresh, especially since there have been almost a dozen MH games already. If you are looking for \"classic\" Monster Hunter, your best title is going to be Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. MH Generations won't be for you either.\n\nTL;DR MHW is the most accessible Monster Hunter and is suitable for newbies who like smart and tactical gameplay. MH Veterans will also find something to love here, as Capcom has changed certain mechanics to make gameplay feel fresh. MHW's graphics may also cause MH Veterans to shed a tear, MH has never looked this beautiful.\n\nNote: I recognize that, at the time of this writing, MHW has lots of connection issues. I attribute this to Steam rather than Capcom; the connection issues only started when Steam rolled out an update. Plus, the game just launched. Launch issues are to be expected for any triple A title.

All connection issues have long since been resolved and a lot of the people who gave it a Negative review never bothered to update their reviews.\n\n\"[i]What's with all this traps and grappling hooks? This is not a Monster Hunter game, this is just an action game with MH skin slapped on it.[/i]\"\n\nOr so I thought when I first saw the trailer for MH World. I don't consider myself an MH veteran, but I've been playing MH since Tri first came out on the original Wii. To me it seemed World was trying to set itself apart from the older titles to the point where it couldn't be considered a true MH title. I reserved further opinions until I played World first-hand and suffice to say, I couldn't be more wrong than that.\n\n[h1]I played previous games. What's up in World?[/h1]\nWorld takes what's offered in the recent games (mostly 4U) and repackage it in an HD offering. Depending on the game you last played, the mounting system and verticality emphasis in 4U might be new for you. It takes some time to get used to, but it feels right at home when you learn how to use it. Also for better or for worse, some mechanics and QoL improvements in Generations, most notably Hunter Arts and Styles are missing.\n\n\"[i]Enough with that crap, [b] what's new in World?[/b][/i]\"\n\nApart from the QoL improvements, there are three main things that I notice really. There are new environmental hazards for you to play around with. For example toads that can paralyze, boulders that can fall at enemies, and flashbomb-like insects. Slingers, mini-bow which shoots select objects which you can find randomly on the wild. Finally, there is also a grappling hook which propels you across distance. Much to the traditional MH tradition, the three are poorly explained especially the environmental hazards. However they make great additions to the core gameplay. I admit I miss the point of using slingers, but these make dungs and flash bombs not as tedious to use.\n\n[h1]Is it a good game for a first-timer?[/h1]\nWorld is first and foremost, catered to newcomers. As a newcomer, it can get daunting to get so much mechanics thrown at you at once. But I think the game did a good job explaining some of the mechanics via the in-game tutorial, something I would really appreciate back when I first started in Tri. The game is considerably easier and also much more \"lived-in\". All in all if you would like to check what Monster Hunter is about, World is a good entry point to start with.\n\n[h1]What about the issues?[/h1]\nRight the issues. From a gameplay standpoint, I think the inventory and crafting system is too dumbed down, but that's something I can live with. Port-wise is something I have issues though. I do have FPS problems, but I'd choose it over the server issues any day. It can be abysmal at times and connection errors will periodically occur even when idling. Right now, I won't hope much for the multiplayer component of the game.\n\nOverall, I think World is a great game with a somewhat troubled port job. While I would recommend waiting for a while if you only want to play multiplayer, the game is still fun when soloed on its own right.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44190575", "timestamp_created": 1534434834, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1572071622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 2667, "playtime_forever": 10233, "steamid": "76561198135186315", "num_reviews": 48}, "timestamp_updated": 1542875156, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560180008411407471", "review": "I hardly ever review games on steam, but this one getting \"mixed\" reviews seems wrong.

As a fan of Monster Hunter, I was certainly already hyped, but after diving in I can say I never expected a game of this caliber. \n\nThe world the player finds themselves in is nothing short of spectacular. The environment is infinitely more lush than any MHW predecessor, the colors are and tone of the world are beautiful, and the player and beast modeling is excellent. Tracking and fighting one of the gorgeous beasts is absolutely epic, and the length of the battles and sturdiness of the monsters makes them truly feel like a worthy adversary. \n\nCombat-wise, the mechanics are just like previous MH games. If you haven't played one, think Dark Souls meets Zelda, with more of an edge toward DS. Each weapon has a very individualized moveset and playstyle, all catering to different types of players. Evading (see: rolling in DS) is your primary damage avoidance---certain weapons may come with shields, as well, or unlock alternative Evade abilities. I, personally, have enjoyed the Insect Glaive, which allows you to zip around through the air attacking super-fast, while simultaneously buffing yourself and your party with your Kinesect offhand (this isn't a spoiler, this is one of the first weapon options you are provided with).\n\nAs for the multiplayer, you can now hang around town with up to 16 in your online session, and then do your quests or expeditions with a party of 4. Smacking monsters and exporing with friends is a blast, but so far does not seem to change the game much, other than making it actually possilbe to nail some of the bigger monsters, which would be quite difficult to solo. \n\nAll-in-all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true adventure to get themselves lost in.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44049197", "timestamp_created": 1533922335, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1547699467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 9184, "steamid": "76561198070023872", "num_reviews": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1534293677, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55928647518157959", "review": "Best Game I've played in a long time, really rewards skill.

I'm revising this review to a \"Yes\" recommendation.\n\nWell, it's got issues. That's for sure. I'm not particularly sure what Capcom was doing in the time between the console launch and the PC launch, but it couldn't have been optimization or any actual work porting. The core gameplay is there, and it's both fun for veterans and accessible for folks just coming into Monster Hunter. The biggest issue is virtually everything surrounding that, which poses a problem, as you might imagine. I want to believe it's going to be addressed via patches but it's pretty obvious that some of the issues are so glaring that Capcom neither wants nor cares to fix them.\n\nAudio is fine. Monster Hunter isn't exactly known for having amazing music, but you still get the odd tune or two that might stick in your head. Game has a lot of language options, which is nice if you'd like to play with Japanese VO while keeping English subtitles. Good luck using the ingame voice chat, though, because it's whisper quiet and there's no option to adjust it anywhere. Nice.\n\nGraphics are graphics, I guess. It's the prettiest Monster Hunter game, but considering that Monster Hunter is primarily a handheld franchise (with a lot of solid console games, though) don't expect it to be mindblowing. Something with the TAA causes a 1 frame motion blur that's pretty annoying, and that can be fixed by changing the anti-aliasing type to FXAA. There's no options for changing depth of field, and the game has an extremely annoying volumetric fog addiction that runs the performance up, so you might benefit from turning that off. When running in 60fps I notice a slight constant jitter on the player character while moving. Not sure what causes that.\n\nNetworking is, frankly, an absolute mess and if Capcom had any dignity they'd be embarrassed. The online component is so clearly tailored for the console market's seemingly infantile understanding of how lobbies and the like work, and it's not even functional half the time. If you want to play with friends, expect to have to restart the game until it decides to list their name in your online session list. After that, get ready to go into any story quest, watch all the cutscenes, and then back out to the lobby just so they can join you. If that sounds great, you're in for a treat, because once you're playing together there's no promise that the game won't just disconnect you all from one another and boot you back to the lobby in offline mode. Speaking of offline mode, there's no way to natively start in offline mode from the main menu, which worries me for when the servers go down. I can load up Portable 3rd or Freedom Unite from years ago and still play with friends using an adhoc server. Will I be able to say that about MHW?\n\nOverall, it's messy. The gameplay is really good, but there's just so much annoying stuff right now that I don't know if I can recommend it. It just seems like Capcom underestimated the size of the PC market and its anticipation of the game, because these aren't flaws that they could just let slide. If they aren't fixed in the coming weeks, the only message that it's going to send is that Capcom doesn't care about the PC market and just wants your money. I had decent hopes after the handling of the port of Dragon's Dogma, but it wasn't the same case for MHW.\n\nIf they fix the issues, maybe I'd recommend it.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44071499", "timestamp_created": 1534000522, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579954481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1611, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_forever": 11702, "steamid": "76561197995842682", "num_reviews": 26}, "timestamp_updated": 1578857550, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558394193649291992", "review": "This game is FUN AS HELL! :D Probably the best CO-OP game of all time!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "52330579", "timestamp_created": 1561877639, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1561983513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 1324, "steamid": "76561198123154858", "num_reviews": 25}, "timestamp_updated": 1561877639, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558232903480529785", "review": "I always wished Monster Hunter would come to PC with next-gen graphics.\n\nIf you like Monster Hunter, you already know what you are in for; IMO, this game only improves on the already great formula!\n\nGraphics are very good (in a Monster Hunter way xd) and the game itself, the more I play it the more fun it is, with a good variety of monsters and weapon types.\n\nThe music is breathtaking.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44763411", "timestamp_created": 1537094217, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1550521706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 8505, "steamid": "76561198011358259", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1537203716, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558078587055206299", "review": "spent 20 hours killing a chicken for parts, not because I needed them, but because it hit me with a rock once", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44349608", "timestamp_created": 1535114432, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579993861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 843, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 19992, "steamid": "76561198139527533", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1535114432, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558030903339385986", "review": "Awesome game, would recommend to anyone.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47471419", "timestamp_created": 1544570377, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580129175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3555, "num_games_owned": 233, "playtime_forever": 30120, "steamid": "76561198002549793", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1544570377, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558011472225189209", "review": "11/10 amazing fighting mechanics, combos, and many different weapons with their own unique skills.

What was delivered wasn't what I've expected.\n\nThe main game was extremely short for 60\u20ac. After the main game you can start grinding and levelling your Hunter Rank to further upgrade your equipment and fight against the same monsters but with more damage. But the game quickly starts feeling extremely boring afer completing the story. It's not like the story was any good but you got to unlock new areas, monsters and equipment as you progressed which felt very rewarding.\n\nSometimes like randomly when you try to slay an enemy one or sometimes even two large boss enemies will coincidentally pop out and meet up on the same spot. The announcement trailer showed how Anjanath and Rathian fought against each other. My experience is 80% of the time at least one of the two or three enemies will focus on you instead fighing each other even though during that they hit each other with their heavy attacks. Like:\"[i]Sure I will hunt down that annoying human when a Rathalos fires a full charged fireball at me.[/i]\". So to me it is rather a nuisance than a feature. You can use an item that makes one enemy bail out but still an annoying and unnecessary game mechanic since you don't always expect this to happen. I am not sure about this but I also got the feeling that they aren't even damaging each other. Never occured to me that the monster I was hunting died or starting limping after receiving couple of hits from other large monsters.\n\nTried playing Co-Op with friends. Can't really recommend. I don't know how exactly the game scales the difficulty with a party but the monsters became way more tankier and I was better off doing the quests alone. Esspecially because the whole team is allowed to faint at maximum up to three times. Some quests even allow less faints! Also as a closed ranged hunter 50% of the time you need to chase the monster since the AI very often changes its target and runs between them.\n\nSpeaking of Co-Op. I was trying to help a friend since his savegame got corrupted and he had to start a new game. I wanted to carry him through the beginning quests quickly to where he used to be but technically I couldn't. I always got disconnected due to communication errors.\n\nThe gameplay is really difficult at the beginning. Most weapons felt clunky to me. I decided to go with the longsword. The game didn't teach much. Looked up tutorial videos on the weapons. After getting used to it a little it was really fun esspecially the counter mechanic and mounting enemies. But there were still things that bothered me:\n[olist]\n[*]Just pulling out the sword take years. Some combos make your character automatically pull away your sword. Really questionable decision Capcom went with.\n[*]Receiving 1-combo deaths is common due to stuns, large enemy-tag-team attacks and whatnot\n[*]Animation of bouncing off of armored parts is extremely long and will often give the enemy a free hit on you even though you didn't meant to hit that part. Happens a lot with the longsword due to its length and the slow attack speed.\n[*]No animation cancels. Once you've comitted to attack and within milliseconds you realise it was a mistake, you can't cancel and side-roll or counter. Extremely frustrating since post game you can get 1-hit killed or late game 1-comboed. \n[/olist]\nI wished one could have more control over his character. I despise clunky gameplay and stuns and think it is really bad game design. I like to have control over my character and not being locked into slow animations. The only weapon with high speed are the dual swords but they are really situational due to their short range which I didn't like.

WHY ALL THIS HYPE ABOUT THIS GAME???? IT\u2019S BAD! [/h1]\n\n(I was not able to ask for a refund because just to create your character and do the tutorial its take more then 2 hours...)\n\nThis game is like the 55th in the franchise AND AFTER 55 games they didn't manage to do a nice Combat System... When you start a combo, it\u2019s done you can't change the way you attack, you must stop your attack and back off, reposition to attack... LAME and BORING, AND TRUST ME, you will repeat this almost 200 times in a gameplay session and in those 200 times you will get what? 50 full combos. The Combat System is so bad that there is only 5 or 6 weapon that are useful and trust me, useful, is a REALLY BIG WORD, because almost all weapon doesn\u2019t have a decent combo. And the hitbox are TOTALLY BROKEN, you'll get hit from far and without any reason, trust me it\u2019s going to happen a lot\u2026 the hit boxes are really broken. In the Arena mission you will see Canons and ballista and IF you finally manage to hit with the canon the Monster will just take no damage because he was mid animation to jump up while chasing your friend\u2026 WHAT A BAD GAMEPLAY.\n\n[h1] \"...SAVE YOUR MONEY and go play the Free-To-Play, Dauntless, this is the SAME game but with decent combat and connection....\"  [/h1] -Me\n\nOh, and let\u2019s talk about this Connection Error that happen 200 times a day \u201cError Code: 50382-MW1\u201d you can\u2019t play with your friends or Online almost half the time and when you finally get to play with your friends, they get disconnected in the middle of the Monster fight. NEXT, the online is really bad, let me explain how the online works. You enter a server where a maximum of 16 people can join, BUT, there is no point about it because you are alone in town you can\u2019t see them. You can talk to them but not the people on a mission AND THERE IS A WHOOOLLEE chat system with Emote, Emoji and Quote\u2026 BUT FOR WHAT??? If you can\u2019t see them in town??? And there\u2019s this area called \u201cThe Gathering Hub\u201d where you CAN see the other players if they come there but again what the point??? To put a Social area nobody goes?\n\nYour character will clip through everything, wall, ground, objects and more. Your pieces of armor will clip through each other\u2019s and almost all the armors are already freaking ugly and, in the end, you will just hate your character after building a build you like. Your character will look fat and feel fat while walking and fighting, it\u2019s like nobody in the game have brains. If I was fighting Monster like those, I would want something solid and light, so, I can move more freely and have a lot more endurance.\n\nThere is so many items that you'll get lost trying to search one item in your inventory. When you eat food you get a bonus, okay? but after you eat, you can't see if you have eaten or not in any menu and you can't see what bonus the food gave to you and your Palico...\n\nMy opinion about this game?

I'll just cut to the chase.\n\n>Pros:\n-A few things are streamlined in a pretty good way. You have infinite whetstones, picks, and bug nets, and you always have a BBQ spit and fishing rod with you. None of this takes up any inventory space. I guess I enjoyed the flow of having to buy picks, bug nets, and whetstones, but I always took those items with me anyways. You were honestly screwed if you didn't bring whetstones. You'd never run out since you'd have a full stack or so, and you were kind of forced to bring them anyways.\n-Gathering goes by a lot quicker. The animations are faster to the point where you can gather while running by items, and the nodes tend to give you a little bit more herbs and such this time around too. This streamlines the process in a pretty alright way.\n-Every weapon seems to have at least one new thing it can do, and they're all pretty neat.\n-Combat is actually pretty fun, if not a bit too easy.\n-Paintballs have been removed and replaced by the scoutfly feature, which is fair enough. I don't mind actually tracking the monster down.\n-They're adding in new monsters via updates, which is nice.\n\n>Cons:\n-There are only around 30 monsters in the game at the time of writing, and I doubt we're going to see a lot more in the game with the updates.\n-The game is WAY too easy. I was only genuinely challenged a few times throughout the game so far, whereas other MH titles have brutalized me before.\n-There are tempered monsters which are buffed versions of the monsters in the game. It just gives the monster a damage multiplier. It's lazy and not nearly as unique as the hyper, frenzy, and deviant monsters we've seen before.\n-There's so much healing everywhere it's ridiculous. There's not nearly as much pressure from running out of supplies as there was in the previous games because there's free healing everywhere more or less. \n-Armor system is a mess. You can just take whatever pieces of armor you want and slap them together and get full benefits, as a single piece of armor will give you a full skill. There's really not much of a reason to get an entire set anymore.\n-Weapons all look incredibly bland. In previous titles weapons would all be unique looking, but in Monster Hunter World, they're all more or less the two \"bone\" and \"iron\" versions of that weapon with a few edits.\n-Armors actually look relatively bland, too. This is most likely to make it so sets that are all mixed together don't clash as much.\n-Network issues are fairly common. Expect to be disconnected and be unable to connect.\n-A lot of random FPS drops out of nowhere.\n-Denuvo doesn't exactly effect the gameplay, but this game has it. I suppose it's up to you whether you're okay with that or not.\n-You only get about 80 hours or so of content compared to the hundreds you'd get in other Monster Hunters. I'm hoping the G-rank update fixes this.\n\nThis game can be fun at times but they really messed up on several parts, and the slog of getting through hunts that don't really offer much of a challenge kind of makes that fun a little harder to get to.

It was on sale, so i had to buy it, and lemme tell you, i have never been so happy before about buying a game for 47 euros. It might be a bit salty for my wallet, but it was worth it.\n\nFirst things first, Customization - I took me an hour to customize my character. The variety of hair styles, appearance, emotions, voice is just huge. For example if you try to make yourself, it will take some time to decide between which lip shape to choose.\n\nSecond, Landscapes - I just love, LOVE games with some beautiful sceneries. When i play open world games like this i really love to take alot of screenshots, so this is just perfect for me.\n\nThird, Story - Story is like one of the important things for me, when i pick up a new game. Since i have played this only for an hour, i can't really tell anything about it yet. So far i have seen some characters, and some action going on at the beginning of the game.\n\nForth, Multiplayer - As much as i have seen other streamers play this game, the monster fights are HARD, so its SUPER handy if you have a friend to play this game with, because its much easier like that. So this is a really good game to pick up, if you are looking for a game to play with your friends as well.\n\nOveral - The game is beautiful and full of adventure. The game might have costed 47 euros, but i am so damn positive, that i won't regret the decision of buying it.\n\nP.S. Since the game is about fighting monsters, this will be one damn good game to grind, with endless monster fights.

Though I am not as hardcore as those thoudsand-hour players, I still would like to talk a little about this game.\nLemme talk about the biggest problem for this game first: not enough content. This game is designed to be grinding and I must say there are just too few monsters and maps. My personal favorite is MHGU(3ds/switch) content-wise.\nThe graphics is AWESOME....... for a monster hunter game. It is mediocre if you put it in a larger scale with all those new fancy looking 3A titles, but it's the BEST for a monster hunter game. And that pretty much wraps up 80% of why this game is good. A monster hunter game with good graphics..... just WOW.\n1.Combat\n    The combat system is always the core element for monster hunter, just like its prequels this one deliveries top-notch combat system. It is simple, easy to get a hang on, but very hard to master. For beginner there are easier weapons to choose from and later you will find those \"easy\" weapon also has depth that requires a lot of practice to master. Take my personally fav weapon for example, lance is not played by a lot because of its relatively simpler movement set: poke, charge and counter. These three movement covers 99% of lance combat however it takes timeless effort to master when to poke, how many times should you poke, when to counter, etc. 10/10(though i miss the hunter arts and style)\n2.Story\n    you are sapphire star and now you have to collect some mushroom for our chef. 0/10\n\nYep, that's it, this game is all about hunting monsters and nothing else. One more thing I would like to address is the monster design. Other than the older ones(shown in prequels) the new ones honestly seem to be a little dull. I dont blame the dev because they intended to deliver a more \"realistic\" feeling in this game, unlike previous ones it feels more like a magic world. This is still a very decent MH game(now that the connection problem is solved) and if you can find some friends to play with I think you will have a great time and since this one is the easiest of all MH games it's a good starting point if youve never played MH. 8.8/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "51419053", "timestamp_created": 1561366587, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580110854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2776, "num_games_owned": 288, "playtime_forever": 33049, "steamid": "76561198100603588", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1561366587, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "You bash poor big monsters around that were minding their own business until they die and then rip their skin off and make hats of it\n\n10/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "50562849", "timestamp_created": 1557433849, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580075047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1818, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 12253, "steamid": "76561198161548896", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1557434220, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "its pretty good\n\ni like hunting", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "48035201", "timestamp_created": 1546418125, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580024803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 716, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_forever": 35330, "steamid": "76561198096863537", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1546418125, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "This game has the best of both MMO's and single player action RPGs.

The environments and monster designs are far more distinct and beautiful than ever before due to the transition from portable consoles to the more powerful consoles and the pc. The various armour and weapons also look outstanding.\n\nThe game retains the cooperative experience the series is known for with fights that may be difficult and long to solo becoming shorter and easier with allies, however this relies on you and them not falling to the foe. While the game is focused on the multiplayer experience, you can still find enjoyment without friends as you can still tackle monsters solo or find people online with similar goals using the sos flare. The game also retains it's focus on the craftable armour and weapons which can allow for a wide variance in playstyles (especially with the new way skills are handled) from sets focused on status effects, pure damage sets, support sets and whatever you own personal style is. This allows people who enjoy minmaxing to get the most out of the game.\n\nThe gameplay just feels right, it has the movement options, the satisfying combat and and so much more. Movement in a Monster Hunter game has never been as good as in this one: you can evade out of most moves, healing while on the move and the grapple can get you around some areas somewhat quicker. When it comes to the combat, each of the 14 weapons feel satisfying use with each hit carrying the weight you would expect. Furthermore there is basically a weapon type for everyone with each one being unique from one another. Returning from Monster Hunter 4 onward is mounting monsters from air attacks which can lead to powerful beat downs once a monster is knocked down. Finally, When it comes to combat, the game is fair and rewarding (with some exceptions). When you miss or get greedy and get hit, it is your fault rather than an unfair quirk or attack. On the flip side when you cause a monster to flinch before it's attack or knock it down, you are rewarded for your hard work with an opportunity to let loose your most powerful attacks into a monster which becomes more satisfying with a team coming together to pummel it. My only complaints when it comes to the gameplay are that the grapple is criminally under used and the odd actually unfair moves some of the far later monsters have.\n\nSimply put, Monster Hunter World is an amazing game and a great follow up from the previous games. The game is the most accessible yet without compromising the core gameplay of the series. There are many quality of life improvements that really help. The graphics are gorgeous. The cooperative play is satisfying and rewarding.\n\nIf you don't like longer fights in games against sort of damage sponge enemies then this game may not be for you. Also if you came to a monster hunter game expecting a story then you may be a bit lost, it exists and is better than the plot of most of the games in the series but it's not majorly impactful. Otherwise I strongly recommend giving the game a shot as it is a rewarding experience with many appealing aspects.\nI give it a 'Rocket Powered Greatsword/10'.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46838527", "timestamp_created": 1543096498, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1576427152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 11912, "steamid": "76561198067456249", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1543096498, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "1) Post Quest / Join Quest with friends or randoms\n2) Eat your food\n3) Depart\n4) Hunt Monster\n5) Forget to restock your potions and items\n6) Dies\n7) Repeat\n8) Have Fun\n\nBest Game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46362634", "timestamp_created": 1542902760, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1566631785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 22953, "steamid": "76561198069051417", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1542902760, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ufe0f\ufe0f \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ufe0f\ufe0f ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131 \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players ( if you want to master the game )\n\n\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ud83d\udc7e \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2c \ud83d\udc7e ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ud83d\udcb2 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e / \ud835\udc10\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32 \ud83d\udcb2 ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\n\u2611 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\u2610 Free\n\n\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ud83d\udca5 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud83d\udca5 ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2611 Medium\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end\n\n\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ud83d\udc80 \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32 \ud83d\udc80 ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\n\u2610 You just need 2 arms\n\u2610 Ez\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Average (you will need the wiki at first )\n\u2611 Hard\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll [ \ud83d\udd53 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc20. \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32 \ud83d\udd53 ] ll\u0131ll\u0131\u0131ll\u0131ll\u0131\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 -

Team is fixing almost every game breaking issue. (This explains the mixed reviews).\n\nIn previous games, you start the game, create a character, gather items, fish and hunt, and repeat, every rank has its own load of Monsters, they're very challenging and enjoyable to fight. There was basically no story back then, if a problem happens...kill a monster.. if you like a monster....kill it, if someone is stealing your honey....kill it....and so on. At some point it will become grindy and repetitive....RNG was a pain. Lots of that changed in here.\n\nIn Monster Hunter: World they for once added an actual story with NPCs revolving around it.\n\nYou start, create your character and start, you gather & hunt. Every encounter will have its own purpose with exception to few. As you progress you'll find yourself achieving higher ranks, and so fight new monster or even previous monster but harder and much rewarding.\n\nYou craft gear, combine items and use the farm to make sure you never lack the essentials.\n\nTo each armor there are different skills, and so making and armor based on look (fashion hunting) or mixed set (skill based) is very possible. \n\nThere are 14 weapons, each is unique, but all of them fall below two type: Melee or Ranged.\n\nEach will have its own playstyle, and each can be played however you want as long as you have the correct skills set. Some can output very high damage, others can be very defensive and some can be used as support (keep in mind ANY weapon can be used as one of those).\n\nYou also have a companion that helps you very well...they're talking cats....Palicos .\n\n====\nPros:\n====\n\n- The Graphics are amazing (comparing it to any previous generation) It is too good to be real.\n\n- The music is special, some fights have their own unique music and some give you anxiety when you hear them.\n\n- Multiplier is a thing, previous games you could have 4 people in a room, now you could have up to 16, but a quest can have up to 4 hunters with scaling difficulty. You can join other during their hunts or even fire and SOS flare to let others join you if you find yourself in trouble.\n\n- Controls are very flexible, supporting all types of controllers (as long as it is supported by Steam) and Mouse & Keyboard (which can be optimized even further with Macros).\n\n- 14 weapons --> plenty of possible play styles.\n\n- Solo gameplay....yes you're NOT forced to be online to play.\n\n- Grinding is NOT as heavy as previous games, there are specific quests that give much higher chance than regular quests to give rare items. (We're talking about up to 16% drop rate).\n\n- Free Updates, the game has been getting free update since it release, last update was released already, the next one is a payed Expansion almost as big as the base game.\n\n- Mods, Capcom stated its not with nor against modding., there are plenty of mods out there, but if you ever consider cheating please do it offline.\n\n======\nCons:\n======\n\n- PC Optimization is a bit  lacking. It took 6 Months for them to enable actual HD Textures (30 GB aside from the base game). The game CPU usage is still not optimized....I highly recommend using Special K mode to resolve that issue.\n\n- Content Delay, PC was released 8-ish months after consoles, however now we have almost everything the consoles have (with exception to exclusives).\n\n- Hackers sometimes ruin the hunts, but you can easily kick them out if you're the Quest leader or the Session leader.\n\n- Previous games had PLENTY of content....this one is lacking them since the monsters and everything else was designed from scratch. But this issue will be solved with Iceborn release.\n\n=====\n\nI have been a fan of the Franchise since 2004-2005, This game is innovation. it is very addictive, and kinda repetitive but as you make friends and hunt with others or even alone you will always find something new or different to do. \n\nCan't wait for Iceborn and G/Master Rank, returning monster and NEW monsters and MUCH MORE.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45439139", "timestamp_created": 1540502770, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6295, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_forever": 99673, "steamid": "76561198102235250", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1561821994, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "Just my type of game.

This is the first Monster Hunter game I've played and I generally really liked it. For anyone new to the series it's definitely the best one to pick up. The gameplay is basically kind of like boss fights all over the place with differently weighted weapons and so forth. Most movements are slow and you have to commit to the attacks and stuff you do. Every weapon offers a completely different and unique playstyle. First I played through using the Switchaxe and Bow and now on my second playthrough I'm using the Charge Blade and it's a lot of fun re-learning the game (checked other weapons too but those are my mains).\n\nThe actual hunting feels very rewarding and for a game with SO much grinding it does a good job at not making it tedious because you're constantly chainsawing the shit out of those poor innocent monsters, forest animals, lizards, whatever crosses your path. You carve them up for a nice new set of armor. Or capture them so you can fight them again more conveniently. And each fight feels like a proper challenge worth your time. At least if you're playing solo or duo with a smaller group.\n \nMultiplayer can be a bit all over the place there so I would recommend people learn to hunt on their own as well. Both because grouping up doesn't always work and it helps you learn and appreciate the game more. There's also dumb restrictions in multiplayer, you have to have watched the story cutscenes before you are allowed to play with other players, wish IMHO should've been removed. I played through the PS4 version mostly duo with a friend and we still managed somehow but had to do a lot of abandoning quests to co-op through it, especially at the start of the game (later on it's a bit better and they let you group up more). Although duoing the game is pretty fun because you get 4x monster HP (and we kicked ass).\n\nThe game definitely takes some learning and commitment but I would say it is the easiest approachable MH game for sure. There was even too much hand holding in the start of the game in my opinion, because I kept wanting to do harder stuff right out of the bat. And that would be most of my complaints core gameplay wise, throughout Low Rank and High Rank you have plenty of story stuff to do and it easily lasts probably at least 40 hours or more to get to the end of High Rank and start on Tempered monsters, depending on how quick you are (it was about 50+ hrs for me on PS4 iirc, but I took my time). And even after you 'beat' the game you basically just unlock a new tier of monsters and even entirely new ones, so you can keep playing for a very long time without seeing everything. I just wish the game let me fight harder monsters sooner, on PS4 I had fought Tempered Elder Dragons on a friend's investigation before even getting there way later.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSo how is it on PC? The port is not completely terrible, you have decent graphics options, and it runs okay at 1440p on high-ish settings on my 1070 GTX, although I did have to drop some stuff and expected a bit better performance (average something between 45-60 FPS). The multiplayer had some connection issues before but they have improved over some patches. One thing that really bugs me about the game is that the texture quality is really AWFUL in places. Some textures legit look PS2 quality for whatever reason on Full settings and I'm confused how that got past QA as a 'bug'. Even the PS4 version had better texture quality as far as I know so it should really be fixed...(and a fix is coming eventually, apparently?).\n\nAt least compared to the PS4 version the game does load a million times faster, switching between quests takes about 5 seconds at best, and the FPS is better than that version at least. :P (which ran about 30 FPS).\n\nIf you have the PC to run it and the gameplay sounds interesting I'd give it a shot. Otherwise the PS4 version may be better. I felt that it wasn't fair to judge the game purely based on its technical performance so my thumbs up is from the gameplay, which is great. There's some flaws in multiplayer they could fix in future titles for sure though, but it's not all bad.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44492794", "timestamp_created": 1535740521, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580083911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 846, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 5795, "steamid": "76561197977246540", "num_reviews": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1535740521, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "good\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44333471", "timestamp_created": 1535037589, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9739, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 40164, "steamid": "76561198021996941", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1535037589, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "I like this game.

Just fucking buy it. It's Great. Yes there are issues with the online, optimization, whatever. They're going to get fixed with time, like any other game.\n\nI don't normally write reviews, but seeing all the complaining made me feel like some people need some facts.\n\nIf you like difficult games that require you to learn to improve (yeah guy who compares everything to Dark Souls, but has never even experienced it's close cousin that makes it look like a steaming trash fire, Bloodborne), if you like action games, if you are a fan of the Monster Hunter series; you will not be disappointed by this game. The combat is so goddamn smooth and the weapon playstyles so varied, they have something for just about anyone. It can be a oldschool God of War style hack n' slash game with the dualblades, it can be a Gears of War like 3rd person shooter with the bowguns/bow, There's an axe that transforms into a sword Bloodborne style, katanas with a bad ass jump-slash move for weeaboos. There's a lance that's also a GUN. If you're into collecting a bunch of different sick looking armor sets and weapons, congratulations; this game is about murdering big animals and turning their corpses into sweet fucking gear, and then butchering their relatives with it. It is admittedly a huge time sink and a grind, but the gameplay is just challenging enough to somehow make fighting the same thing 30 times engaging rather than being a chore (there are exceptions, but most of the enemies are well designed). If you have a full-time job and a family to take care of, it might be a little harder for you to get into because of the grind. \nI can't really do the gameplay justice with words, so go watch some gameplay on youtube and see for yourself.\n\nFor veterans of the series (why haven't you bought this yet if you have disposable income/time for it), who may have reservations like I did. This is not a watered down experience. It doesn't have G rank, but it's no less difficult or enjoyable because of quality of life changes. All these changes have done is removed the tedium so you can get to the meat of the game, the hunting. Gathering no longer locks you in place with slow animations; crafting combinations have been simplified so you don't have to spend a lifetime skinning kelbis for ancient potions; you don't have to abandon a quest because your dumbass forgot to eat a meal, or left your hot/cold drinks in your storage box. None of those things were good, they were leftovers from the fact that Monster Hunter has basically been a modified version of a ps1 game until now. I could see how things like being able to move while firing gunner weapons, or when using items could be seen with some skepticism. But with how quick and fluid the new monster's attacks are, it would almost be a nightmare being stationary with the low defense gunner's have. And being able to animation cancel healing items is a double edged sword; yes there's less of those 'oh shit' moments where you get mauled to death because you popped a potion when you thought you had time but didn't, but you also run the risk of wasting precious resources when you dodge 1/10 of the way through a mega potion. At it's core it is still very much the series we know and love, just with some modern amenities that change up the game in a positive way. \n\nOkay so for all the people who are writing bad reviews because online issues, or because you're i5 2500k nvidia 500 series 2 gb of ddr3 ram setup that you bought almost a decade ago can't run this game at max settings at 4k 60fps. DISREGARD ALL OF THESE REVIEWS. Yes there are server issues day one, that's a fact. But it's not going to be forever. On it's release day it was the 7th most played game on steam at the time, behind giants like DoTA 2. Yes CAPCOM has developed PC ports and ones that support online multiplayer. But the team that develops this series has never made a PC game. In fact this is the second game in the series that's multiplatform, the other one being for the 3DS/Wii U. It's never been all that popular in the West, despite the fact that it's a cultural phenomenon in Japan where it's produced (they literally have a ride in Universal Studios Japan dedicated to this series). It's never been on PC before. Yes they took 7 months longer than consoles to release it on PC, because they wanted to make sure it worked. But they are testing the waters with this here; this is completely new territory for them and they couldn't have imagined how successful it's launch was. On the release weekend, just like any game, the servers were overloaded and obviously not prepared. And yeah, maybe textures aren't loading properly, or the mouse cursor appears in the middle of the screen when you're using the controller and it's annoying. Get the fuck outta here with that. There are always going to be issues day one with games now, that's just the way it is. These issues are going to fixed with time; even now on consoles there are patches/rebalances/bugfixes being released in a steady stream, and PC isn't going to be any different. Eventually enough resources will be allocated to the games servers that the current disconnects are going to be a thing of the past. There is no way that Capcom won't support and fix the problems of the game that they won't even stick there corporate dicks in because it makes them so much goddamn money. I can only think of a couple games that release free dlc content over their lifespan (Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, excellent games btw) other than monster hunter. Not just skins or anything, but new monsters, maps, actual free fucking content. And there will be fixes that come with that too. Anyone who is complaining right now, calling it a disgrace, or just bitching is a being a child and you should ignore them. Lots of PC gamers feel they deserve something extra because they spent 3000 USD on a pre-build and a 3 4k monitors, but don't realize that optimizing a game for essentially thousands of different systems with different combinations of parts in them is not that realistic. Especially for a team THAT HAS NEVER MADE A FUCKING PC GAME BEFORE.\n\nIf you read through all of this, thank you. I apologize for all the grammatical/spelling errors. I don't even like writing, I just can't stand to see this game have mixed reviews on steam. I've only logged 20 hours so far, but as a long time fan of the series I feel like it's safe to say this is the pinnacle of the series, and it's going to be supported for years to come. I've waited years for this and it's everything I could ever want.\n\n\n\n\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44133707", "timestamp_created": 1534219965, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580086801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 931, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 13576, "steamid": "76561198041816109", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1534219965, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "I'm new to Monster Hunter; MHW is the first one I've played.

It's a subtle thing, but too many games these days portray the protagonist unlike they are.\n\n[u]Gameplay pros:[/u]\n[*] Combat is quite intense. I haven't died many times but I hear it only gets harder as you progress. Reminds me a lot of Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma.\n[*] Combat mechanics have quite a lot of depth to them: enemies have weak points, weaknesses, resistances, and players have several tools at their disposal to take advantage of these.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Cons:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[u]Meta cons:[/u]\n[*] I know $60 USD is not an uncommon asking price for games these days, but I've seen several people turned away for it being too steep a cost.\n[*] While I've not encountered serious performance issues, I've seen several others complaining (justifiably) that the game has been running sluggish\n\n[u]Online cons:[/u]\n[*] For an MMO, the online experience has been patchy for me... I guess the servers are having trouble keeping up right now, which may explain disconnects... but I [b]absolutely hate[/b] how difficult it is to play with friends who are at the same stage as you in the game. (See below)\n[*] Want to progress through the story with your friend? Sorry, this problem has been solved ever since co-op has existed, but we'll need one of you to watch the quest's cinematic before being allowed to join your friend. \n[*] Want to join your friend on an expedition? Sorry, you can't just go in with them, they need to use an SOS flare first.\n[*] Want to see your friend in the main hub area? Sorry, that's clearly impossible to implement, go use the Gathering Hub instead.\n\n[u]Design cons:[/u]\n[*] I really don't mind it, but dialogue is weird in this game. They've obviously hired voice actors for every voice, but they've done a lacklustre job at giving every dialogue voice lines. Some are fully voiced, some are partially voiced, and some are just [strike]Navi[/strike] the Handler going \"hey!\".\n[*] I'm a quiet individual who prefers to use in-game chat when possible in games. This game's chatbox however is TERRIBLE. You get [b]40[/b] characters per message, make them count. \n\n[u]Gameplay cons:[/u]\n[*] Controls are VERY weird, as is the case with most ports of Japanese games. I don't know why, you'd think they could have someone tell them \"Oh hey what if you [i]don't[/i] use V to aim ranged weapons?\"\n[*] Avoid Target Lock at all costs... It's terrible! Combat has been way better for me without it.\n[*] Tutorial coverage seems a bit odd to me. While they do a great job at explaining what they do explain, it feels like they trigger at odd times. For instance I held off on taking any monster capturing quests because I didn't know how to capture monsters yet. Turns out the game gives you the tutorial after loading into a capture quest. Who would've thought!\n[/list]\n\nI know that looks like a lot more negatives than positives, but I still believe the positives outweigh the negatives.

However, I am not lucky enough to be able to dodge the bullet that is this game's wacky fucking servers. It is borderline impossible playing this game multiplayer most of the time because of how spotty the servers are. It's a huge shame considering how co-op focused this game is.  If you're on the fence about buying this, I'd definitely wait until the performance and server issues are fixed. \n\nHowever, I've been having a blast with this game solo. This is my first real experience with Monster Hunter and I've not been disappointed thus far. There's a lot of depth to this game. Yes, it can be very confusing. Yes, it's grindy, as Monster Hunter has always been, but the experience you get from actually participating in hunts pretty much negates the tediousness of any of these factors. \n\nIt all comes down to the monster hunting, obviously. It's split into a couple of phases. First, you have the prep phase. This occurs in the town hub where you pick up the quest, upgrade your weapons, buy supplies, eat food for certain buffs, etc.\nOnce that's done, you depart on your quest and move to the hunting phase. The hunts themselves are paced really well in order to give you plenty of action while also allowing you to recuperate and regroup as the hunt moves from section to section. During this phase you usually have a time limit of 50 minutes, but it can be lower depending on quest modifiers. \nOnce your prey has been hunted, you enter the final phase of the hunt, the looting phase. You have 60 seconds to carve up the monster for any loot you can find, as well as picking up anything else you might want from the environment. After the timer is up, you're teleported back to HQ to repeat the process. \nThe most rewarding thing about this whole process is once you start to learn monster patterns and behaviors, you can start applying that knowledge to both prep accordingly and exploit patterns and behaviors of the monster. Eventually you start taking down the monsters faster and more effeciently. It's an RPG where you, the player, start to feel like a more experienced hunter as your character progressees.\n\nThe game allows you to pick from 14 different weapons as well, each accomodating to a different playstyle with unique combos and upgrade trees. I hear the game's combat often compared to Dark Souls, but I feel like it's a little Dark Souls mixed with a fighting game. Using the right combos at the right time is key. Add the player's wide arsenal with the diversity of the many monsters in the game, and you have a very challenging and engaging combat system that's up to the task of keeping you interested well past the 100 hour mark. \n\nIt's also important to note that while this game is great solo, it truly shines when you're playing co-op with a team. Difficulty scales with how many players are in your party, so coordinating with your friends to take down a monster as effeciently as possible adds even more depth to this already endless pit of a game. However, this game does some very strange things with multiplayer. If you and your friends are on the same quest in the story, the game simply won't let you depart on that quest together, telling you that you're not far enough in the story to join them. Good luck even getting into a session with your friends, though, considering how trash the servers are right now.  \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game. As I said, if you're on the fence, just wait until all the server and performance issues are sorted out. This is a game that really shines when you're teaming up with your friends, but as of right now that's not very reliable.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44084508", "timestamp_created": 1534047229, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580109902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 718, "num_games_owned": 587, "playtime_forever": 9061, "steamid": "76561197971929019", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1534047229, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 6, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "It baffles me to see such a low rating for such an impressive game, and the first Monster Hunter to truly come for PC.\n\nNow, if you are new to this game and startled by the red sea of negative reviews, most of them talk about:\n- Bad optimization or performance.\n- Game is too grindy.\n\nFirst of all, i can't really say the game is badly optimized, it's just resource demanding. If you have a beefy computer, it'll run at 50-60fps with no issue (other than your room feeling like a stove while you play)\n\nSecondly, of COURSE it's grindy, can't you see the massive \"MONSTER HUNTER\" in the title? \n\nI can understand many people's confusion about the pacing of this game. It's the first \"mainstream\" title of this series and the first to ever touch Steam, some new players latched onto it before understanding what the series is about and got really frustrated, i get that. \n\nOverall, let's point out what Monster Hunter World is.\n\n- You hunt and capture monsters of various different kinds, shapes and sizes, with different weaknesses and resistances (both elementally and locally, in the monster's body). The purpose of it, aside the story's progression and whatnot, is to collect resources. TONS of resources. Buckle up.\n\n- You have 14 different types of weapons with large crafting trees for different elements and status effects, qualities and etc. Each weapon can change the whole entire way you look and play the game, some are more tank-y, some are more agressive, others more support-y, ranged, up close to the monster's ass, large and slow to the small and quick, insect q-tip sending you through the airs, there's everything for everyone.\n\n- Along with that, you have tons and tons of armor sets, decorations (which work like enchantments), charms and with those, various useful status effects of every kind, allowing for lots and lots of different builds that go well with different playstiles, the list goes on.\n\n- There are lots of useful items you can use mid-battle to help you, like traps, special kinds of ammo for your wrist-crossbow-thing and more, adding a new dimension to aid in your hunts.\n\nAll those elements conjugate with the fantastic AI of the monsters, and makes the combat system absolutely incredible. It feels very much like Dark Souls in the sense of how you need to think and react to certain circunstances, learn attack patterns from the creatures and master a certain kind of weapon, the main difference being that Monster Hunter World has a much deeper variety between all weapons, so you got lots of hours to practice and master each and everyone of them.\n\nI mean, this behemoth of a wall of text is starting to get too nasty for you all, so I'll cut it here. The game is gorgeous, but only if you're looking for a deep, grindy and long game to learn and enjoy in your own way. \n\nIf you are a long-time MH fan, the game may feel too small, shallow or easy, but it's still worth just to see this franchise being polished up for the new-gen technologies (believe me, this game is visually jaw-dropping)\n\n8,7/10, go for it.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44080132", "timestamp_created": 1534027746, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1576118069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 9393, "steamid": "76561198054889904", "num_reviews": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1542832553, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "My mind is blown that someone designed this game and was like \"Yup, totally makes sense that you have to left click to talk to people in town but right click to talk to people in the world\".

Here's what I did to fix it and I hope it helps you guys too. So it seems that the bad optimizations are part the game engine, and part the bad profiles on Nvidia's part for said game. \n\nSo after installing a little program called Nvidia Inspector, running the profile inspector, locating the Monster Hunter World Profile and Deleting it, the game suddenly ran perfectly even in areas that would absolutely kill my FPS on medium settings. So now I am playing the game happily on maxed settings without any hitches or ever dropping frames which is GREAT!\n\nSome video settings are still broken mind you... Water Reflections still don't work right and texture setting is still broken (unless you download the High Res Texture DLC which is free and highly recommended for 1070 8GB Vram and up Card owners...), but at least the game is stable enough now and I don't have to make the game look ugly for it. It's a good thing too because this game is honestly great, It's everything I've ever liked in Monster Hunter games and More!

You'll have to do quite a bit of tweakning to get the game running well, especially on lower end specs, or use a mod or three (somewhat fixed between Nvidia Driver updates and recent QoL updates, Getting more frames than when game launched but can still cause issues on certain setups).\n\n-Keyboard and Mouse Controls may be hit or miss, even tho they are fully rebindable. Mouse Accel that you cannot turn off (Mouse Controls fixed as of 9/20/18 thanks to Type 2 mouse aim setting, but the way the Radial Menu handles on K+M can still use some work)...\n\n-Cannot rebind Controller at all (just like Dark Souls), well... technically you CAN swap some buttons around but it is so limited it may as well not exist. Default Controller layout may turn some people off...\n\n-Combat is most definitely not for everyone (slow, clunky and incredibly weighty)\n\n-Tutorial is a bit slow paced, but this may not be a bad thing since it's a bit more hands off than previous installments...\n\nIf you want to know more about the PC version of Monster Hunter World, I highly recommend watching the Digital Foundry Analysis vid, both for comparison and troubleshooting purposes as it is highly insightful...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFBLdYf05Yo\n\nI currently give MHW on PC a 9 out of 10, Highly Recommended to buy, especially on sale!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44074595", "timestamp_created": 1534008527, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580103292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3506, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 22612, "steamid": "76561198047762938", "num_reviews": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1578521490, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "review": "Try not to let the influx of bad reviews sway you too much. The game has just come out, people want to be mad about something, and most people I know had played it for 16 to 20 hours straight because they loved it so much. Those people aren't reviewing it. It's the people who want to be mad who are reviewing it.\n\nNow onto the port. The port isn't great. For the 6 months we had to wait for it, it could have been better. But the DS1 port was god fucking awful and people still found ways to play it. The loading times are crazy fast, the graphics are super nice (although you need to disable a few things for optimization and that sucks) the systems that made sense on console have been changed to make sense on PC instead, so they definitely thought about \"does this feature make sense on steam? How should we change it?\"\n\nThe game is a typical Monster Hunter. You fight monsters so you can farm it for a set that allows you to fight another monster, which is just a stepping stone to a third monster, ad infinitum. The combat is fluid and rewarding of skill and mastery, and those who learn the ins and outs of their weapons and the monsters will be rewarded. I personally feel some weapons came out worse than previous games with their changes in mechanics or moves (Sword and Shield, Dual Blades) but most got much, much better when compared to the previous games with what was added to their arsenal. \n\nWhat makes this game such a definitive version over MHG on the 3DS or MGU on the Switch is the absolute colossal amount of Quality of Life changes. Gathering is faster, so many of the crafting recipes were streamlined so you weren't farming for hours to make an ends game worth of one tool you needed. Things you needed for every hunt are always on your hunter at all times, and don't take up inventory space. The new Charm systems, the Armor and Weapon upgrade system, and the new Armor Skills systems are all such a huge improvement over the old ones. The maps are sprawling and large, without the loading screens that plagued the game in between zones of the same map in the old games. This is both a plus and a minus, but they changed the potion drinking mechanic to account for that minus. \n\nIt is clear Capcom put lots of thought and attention into this game. But it isn't perfect. In the old games, it was impossible to do the main village quests with other people. Those were always solo offline only. The quest pool was separated, and lots of things in the game were locked behind your solo progression in the game, even things you needed for online play. They changed it, and even though it is better than it was, it's not as good as it should be. People who are complaining about the \"difficulty\" of playing with friends are blowing it so far out of proportion, maybe they should seek a different game if figuring out how to play with friends is that hard. Also, currently the servers are dying, and you need to re-host your game server occasionally if a friend gets dropped or you need to add a new one.

This game is the ANSWER - Go YouTube a video of the gameplay!  ITS AMAZING! \nIts Shadow of Collosus meets Assassin's Creed meets Final Fantasy meets Tomb Raider.  \n\nThis game has the RIGHT AMOUNT of grinding, upgrading, story, exploring, questing, CO-OP PLAY etc.  Its a GREAT game with a HUGE variety of weapons (fight/play style) choices - all of which can be upgraded further.  You can use a 600 pound hammer that plays like its actually HEAVY, you can use a heavy GUN with all kinds of custom crafted ammo, you can use twin daggers that have VICIOUS crit chance... and there's over 10 other weapon types!  \n\nEverything has a skill tree!  It's creative and well thought - there is tons to hunt and grind and explore.  The maps are HUGE with 3 layers of height/depth.  So basically each area map is made of 18ish smaller maps, and each of those maps can have a higher ground/lower ground map.  Its EASY to utilize though, and you can set waypoints for yourself on anything or any creature you want!   \n\nYou get an ADORABLE little buddy to fight alongside you who can help you out by dropping heals or setting traps - he also routes out items for you and even levels up himself!  You can equip and upgrade his sh!t too!  The attention to detail in this game is AMAZING - ex: your little friend hops on a tiny raft when you go in water too deep for him.\n\nAND THE CO-OP!  YOU CAN PLAY CO-OP and I'M NOT TALKING THAT CRAPPY SPLIT SCREEN CO-OP IM TALKING REAL MUTLIPLAYER!  AND ITS SO DAMN FUN!  You can d!ck around in the same area for HOURS and not get bored!  You can capture monsters, track monsters, kill monsters, carve monsters, break monsters, jump onto the backs of monsters, run and hide from monsters....  ITS SO GOOD.  You actually do have to hide if you run into something you're not yet ready to take on - which makes it FUN - its not stupid-easy like so many other games out there!\n\nThe environment is endlessly open - you can harvest, farm, dig, mine, grab, capture almost everything!  The freedom of movement in the game is FANTASTIC.  You can slide, rappel, climb, dodge et all. \n\nThe negative reviews from its first release on PC are due to the controls - the game started on console (PS4, XBOX) - where it did amazing, by the way.  When CAPCOM ported it over to PC there were some control issues, but most - if not all - of that has been resolved now.  It doesn't take long to tackle the menus and inventory and all the information you need is there.  Meeting up with your friends is a little non-intuitive, but really its not difficult and once you do an Expedition with a friend, you will be immersed for HOURS.  Basically, you have to do the first 1 or 2 quests alone.  Then, you have two options.  You start a Quest/Expedition and send up an SOS which your friend will search for and then join you.  OR, better yet, just start a Quest/Expedition while you and your friend are in the same online session, and he/she can search for it and join.\n\nHaven't had this much fun with a game in AGES.

The story, setting, characters and anything outside of raw mechanics is easily forgotten, and uncomfortably juvenile. The fluff of this game is the kind that reminds me of a childhood playing video games but not in a friendly nostalgic way, more of a \"I can't believe I ever thought this wasn't stupid\" kind of way.\n\nPlaying this game, I see an absolute mountain of potential. The core gameplay of hunting a monster is great. Finding the clues, identifying creatures, following tracks, locating nests, surveying the environment, locating hazards, laying traps, and generally figuring out the best way to kill this creature before engaging in exciting and very long, arduous battles; its all amazing. Where the game falls short is that it isn't a low budget indie game directed by a single team with a single vision, because this game is a huge mess of the most embarassing and anime cliches that do nothing to benefit the game and everything to detract from it. \n\nIf you've got $60 to spare, and really enjoy MMO style grind, I would reccomend the game as a fun play once you get through the absurdly lengthy tutorial portion. However, if you plan to play this with friends, I wouldn't suggest it unless you and your friends are all very patient. The non-gameplay parts of the game are so mind numbingly stupid I can't comprehend how a company as big as CAPCOM allowed it to happen. It's so bad that I feel they need to issue a public apology to anyone who bought the game, and anyone who has been a fan of their products. That this is a console port is not an acceptable excuse for how pisspoor the interface is. Even when you finally figure out how to play with your friends, the execution is so clunky, that it still fails to work about half the time.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you'll play the game for a week and enjoy parts of it, and generally kind of have fun playing it. You'll get a lot of hours out of it during that one week; and after that, you'll feel that there's really nothing worth replaying it for, because even though you may have new armors and new weapons to grind, they don't actually do anything new, or change the game at all.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44195121", "timestamp_created": 1534451641, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1536074353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_forever": 4403, "steamid": "76561197990133765", "num_reviews": 20}, "timestamp_updated": 1534451641, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547014415264129639", "review": "This is one of the greatest games I've ever played.

Story is alright but nothing too fancy just like the other games. I play on a prebuilt crap ACER desktop with a 1060 and get very good game play. Anyway here are my thoughts:\n\n[Pro]\n- Good Graphics and animation\n- Balanced in a way so even if you don't have friends MOST quests are solo-able.\n- Lots of even quest to gather good weapons, armour, and items. As a Great Sword user, with the proper augmentation and gems, the Wyvern Ignition Impact which is obtainable thorugh a event quest is very very good.\n- No pay to win\n- Fulfilling when you beat a elder dragon for the first time\n- Very interactive field. \n- No cancerous online players who chat crap or talk crap about you\n\n[Cons]\n- Some quests are definately harder to solo. (Eg, Kulve Taroth, Behemoth, etc)\n- Shop seems kinda lacking so I use a mod that allows me to buy great potions and flash pods which are otherwise a pain in the ass to make if you want to do a lot of quests in a quick succession\n- Great Sword designs are mostly all the same \n- Some weapons types are better than others imo\n- Not beginner friendly at all. I played MH before so I knew basic stuff but if you're a beginner, you might have a difficult time figuring things out. One thing that is very annoying is weapon combos, The practice range doesn't show you all the combos so you're better off watching a YT video.\n- Once you beat everything, it's kinda like, what now? (Guess this can go with all games) I help my friends out tho.\n- Have to watch all cutscene before someone or you friend can join or reply to your SOS call during quest,\n- Sometimes Glitchy. When I play with my friend, whenever one of us dies, our screen freezes for a short time.\n- Some times, monsters are a bit glitchy but it rarely is a problem.\n- Hate pink rathian's running around move where she constantly knocks you down repeatedly\n\nOtherthan that, its an all right game overall. Will 10/10 buy Icebourne when it comes out even thought I can kinda guess what monsters will come out XD.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "48496638", "timestamp_created": 1548201663, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575013814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 13678, "steamid": "76561198346724245", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1548201663, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546903491020202637", "review": "Online issues fixed guys.\nLet's give the 90%", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44348289", "timestamp_created": 1535109132, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3467, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 14845, "steamid": "76561198011331431", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1535109132, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546875", "review": "dont get fooled by the Mixed reviews, thats largely because of its bad launch,\n\neverything is fixed by now, and its one hell of a addicting game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47989787", "timestamp_created": 1546270060, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579817907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 280, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 7334, "steamid": "76561198033497515", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1546270060, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546868026256561279", "review": "Great game, awesome textures, runs ok on highest settings with a gtx 1080.

There are so many different and challenging monsters to hunt. The 14 weapons all play so differently from each other that you could play the game through 14 times and it wouldn't feel like you were redoing it. And because of this the grind takes a very long time to feel like a grind.

I think across the board I have something ludacris like 14k hours total, yes, even the lil spin-off titles and whatnot. I won't waste a lot of your time, and I will try to make my review look pretty so it's not just a wall of text. The list will mostly be for people who are new to the series. Those that are grizzled MonHun vets can look to the section below the bullet points.I hope this review helps! :D\n\n[b] Things the game does right [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Pretty to look at. Really fantastic graphic overhaul for a series that has always looked like someone took a crap on a PS1 game and shipped it out 2k18.\n    [*]Easy to learn, hard to master. You can get the hang of a weapon and still take hits. It's challenging and fun to try and get out of that Teostra fight without taking a hit and completing it in under 10 minutes.\n    [*]Lots of little things to do besides hunt monsters! Stalk little critters and make them your friends, pet a poogie, try and catch really big fish, read up and learn about all the monsters to be more effective in combat! Do more than bonk with big stick 24/7! Wowie!\n    [*]Good music! The music is actiony but still that classic monster hunter symphonic sorta style. It works well for tense fights and really enhances the game. Gets yer lil heart goin in tough situations.\n    [*]Limited hand holding. You want a tutorial? Grab a weapon and head into the training room and smack around some barrels until you kinda get the hang of your selected weapon. Best way to train though is LIVE COMBAT!\n    [*]Letting you do your own thing. You aren't really forced into the story. Wanna give it a break and farm up something in the optionals with friends or do arena hunts to practice something? Go right ahead! Manage your game how you want to!\n    [*]Variation. You can go for a hard tanky lance build or skill in Critical Eye and go for a more aggressive build. This really keeps the weapons fresh and lets you further your own style of play so you're not always stuck playing the same way every time. There is no \"best build\" only good players.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Things the game is really shit at [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Letting you play with your friends. It's not so much an issue anymore, but right off the bat this console port was a multiplayer disaster and was really off-putting when you wanted to experience this new game with your friends, only to find them dropping from the hunt partway through and wasting your time.\n    [*]Being creative. Previous games in the title had the most badass and awesome weapons and armor! They really showed off the style, flair, and design of the monsters they were made from. Best you will get in Monster Hunter World is a boring steel whatever weapon with maybe some feathers or scales stuck onto it. There are maybe 3 or 4 different weapons for each type of weapon that actually LOOK unique and interesting.\n    [*]Bare bones content. Seriously. You will get bored of fighting Jurassic Park monster #54 very quickly. The variety is seriously lacking. Previous titles like 4U had a duo of monsters that attached to each other to make the combination even more deadly, a Goku ape, a literal Mayan snake monster, inflatable shark, a nice handful of extremely large monsters that ranged from a big lumbering ancient dragon that walked down a narrow path all the way up to a big goof chameleon that could go invisible!\n    [*]Armor Pigment. I don't know why this bothers me so much, but hear me out. You'd think getting to add some custom coloring to your armor would be cool, right? WRONG, DUMMY! Most of the armors will let you paint ehhh lets say like some small things like straps and whatnot. It's so limited for most of the pieces that I hardly bother with most of my mixed sets.\n    [*]Giving you something to strive for. If you're like me, you come from a line of games where you oogled being in G-rank and fighting monsters that were faster and even some you've never seen before! Monster Hunter World removes all of this by creating \"tempered\" monsters. They are the same monsters you've fought, no new ones, except they hit harder and have a smidge more health.\n    [*]Cutscenes! Want your friend to jump into your game and help you out? Well if it's your first time doing... quite a few different story missions, tough shit. Your friend will have to sit around and wait until you have watched an unskippable cutscene before they can even accept the quest! 4U had every hunter watch the lil movie and you could even all vote to skip it like Overwatch events.\n    [*]Talking. Monster Hunter games previously told the story mainly through text. Lots of funny things to be said. Adding voiced characters really took away from what the games previously really focused on; THE MONSTERS. You watched a cutscene of your hunter or the story characters gasping or cheering, that was their voice. Now you've got like this sort of... realistic vibe going on with idiots you don't care about yapping your ear off (like The Handler). It sucks, the lips don't even move along with the words correctly. Focus less on the people and more on how awesome the monsters are, that's why we are here.\n[/list]\n\n\nThere is plenty I might have neglected to really speak about above, but for the moment, those are the biggest positives and negatives about the game, coming from the standpoint of someone who has played the previous titles and basically slaves away on these games. Hands down, this game is BORING. I found myself 100 hours in, really pushing myself to find something to do. I literally had no direction at all! The game drops you off at the end of the story, very low hunter rank, and just basically tells you to sniff dirty footprints and lick mucus until you find the tempered monsters.\nFrom that point on you will be rinse and repeating the same monsters you've fought throughout the entire game, except they just hit harder. It's actually really disappointing. Monsters like Xeno don't even come close to real end-game monsters from previous games like the Fatalis or Rajang. It's slow, telegraphs everything like it's in slow motion, and sucks gigantic balls. In previous games, you got into G-rank. That was where you put hair on your gooch and fought the monsters that really were absolute hell to take on 1-1. Suddenly you are facing new monsters you have never seen before and boy do they either move fast and slam you hard or they have really nifty attack patterns you have to learn to avoid taking a beam of some elemet to the face, vaporizing you instantly. World just... LACKS all that high-class stuff that separated good hunters from REALLY good hunters.\nIf I can make one big comparison, it would be Glavenus compared to Anjanath. In Generations, this was a t-rex with a really sick twist. This bigass freak had a bladed tail it could run across its jaw to heat it up before spin dashing at you. It had flair, personality, style, and was a really cool monster to fight all around. Anjanath on the other hand is like Glavenus' stupid little brother that has allergies. Not only does his \"fire breath\" come out as a lame sneeze, his design is much less WOW than Glavenus. It's simplistic and uninspired, which I guess kinda fits World's narrative for being \"more realistic\", but then again they throw in shit like Teostra and Kushala just to get old fans of the series rock hard, so that all goes out the window.\nI think the thing that was most infuriating to me personally was the weapon/armor designs. I found my friends on Discord asking me \"What weapon/armor is that?\" because the designs are so flat. In all the previous titles, the armor and weapons you created from monster parts really expressed the personality and design of the monsters they came from.\n\nI ran out of characters!

Severe networking issues that remain unfixed, some crippling performance issues for players at the low end of the hardware range for the game, and a general lack of developer communication are really hurting the launch.\n\nThat said, disregarding the state of the port, the game's improved on (or simply fixed) many of the small quality of life issues that made previous titles less enjoyable. Items can be set to autocraft upon picking up their materials during missions, hitboxes on almost every monster are now realistic instead of large boxes around limbs, heads, and feet that hit you from metres away. The dodge iframe window for the player seems to be smaller, but this is somewhat less of an issue than it would be if the aforementioned hitbox issues hadn't been fixed. Tranqs now throw at the player's feet rather than through the air, and affect the area around their point of impact, making captures significantly easier. Plates and gems are possible to meld with Wyverian prints.\n\nThe lack of G rank content is something of a downer, though we may see it in the future. I was also expecting a much wider range of monsters (many of the older monsters appear to be missing from the game, though I've yet to clear the hunter rank grind to confirm this). There's much to be said for or against the game, and ultimately the only reason this is getting a thumbs up is because there's no middle option.\n\nIf you're running a good rig, give the game a go.

If you've played previous titles you will enjoy this game, and if you're new to the series the game is very good, if somewhat difficult to get the handle of. I enjoy the fact that the devs have added so many monsters from previous titles, and keep adding more with events and free (not counting the Iceborne expansion) dlc/updates. The one major issue I have with the game is that there are several weapons in the game that just look...lazy. Many (especially for hammers) weapons and their upgrades look like they are just copy pasted variations of bone weaponry. There are still many cool looking weapons within MHW, but it feels like weapons lack the variety they did in previous titles. Luckily on PC if you feel like it, there are several mods that can change how weapons look so the problem is alleviated, if not by the devs themselves. All in all I'd say the game is fun, difficult when taking on endgame content (as it should be) and very much worth the money. 9/10\nP.S.

I played the entire game in Keyboard and Mouse, but after HR 70 I switched to a Dualshock controller and all the controls felt much better and easier to use. \n\n- The monsters feel a little sloppy compared to games like MH4U or Generations.\n\n-The maps do not feel original:\n     - The Ancient Forest is a terribly design jungle themed map, for navigation is a pain for a new player veteran or a noobie.  \n     - The Wildspire Waste isn't bad, but it's boring like the majority of Monster Hunter desert maps.\n     - The Coral Highlands is great in design and flow of navigation, everything seems like it's where it needs to be. \n     - The gimmicks in the Rotten Vale just feels wrong because in previous Monster Hunter games, places with environmental damage are able to be relinquished with a consumable like hot/cold drinks, but in the Rotten Vale, there is no way to stop the ticking of your health (I've used Effluvia Resistance +3 and it did not work).\n     - The mishmash of the volcano and cave regions/biomes in the Elder's Recess feels out of place.\n\n-Also the fact that 99% of the missions are hunting quests and little to no gathering quests gave me no incentive to farm materials by myself (even 100+ hours in I'm still struggling to accumulate a large quantity of flashpods, mega demondrugs/armorskins, etc).\n     - Having to find tracks to advance the story is not something I enjoyed, it took away from the story and although it made sense, it was obnoxious (especially tracking the footsteps of Kushala, Teostra, and Vaal later on since those are not \"one expedition and you're done\").\n\n- In all Monster Hunter games, Low Rank is always the worst. It's slow, tedious, unforgiving, and is really a basis of collecting materials before you're given an actual challenge. \n     - The first few ranks until mid high rank are not at all immersive or fun. After mid high rank, monsters become much more fun to hunt and you're given much more variety in armor and weapons. \n     - Weapon design is lazy. \n     -I know Monster Hunter's stories were never their strong suite, but in games like MH3U where you arrive to an island whose citizens believes an anonymous monster is causing earthquakes, or in MH4U where you help a band of caravaneers discover a new monster. Although their story may not have been the most developed they still had a sense of immersion, but in World, the pace of quests comes out at such a rapidfire speed that I felt like I was speed running a game than actually enjoying it. \n\n- Once you make it to endgame, decoration farming and a select few Arch Tempered quests are the only objectives.\n     - The RNG of decorations is so insane, it feels like a chore just to get some armor skills than any sort of accomplishment.\n     - Arch Tempered monsters have such a high learning curve and unforgiving damage that it forces you to solo just to keep the monster under control (Arch Tempered Multiplayer is actually a shitshow), so this can really outweigh the desire to painstakingly learn to flawlessly hunt solo or give up and enjoy post game with friends. \n\n- Overall, it's not a terrible game. I see that Capcom is trying new things that could appeal to a larger audience. I feel that after Iceborne and they produce another AAA Monster Hunter title, they should:\n1. Extend the story.\n2. Allow players to join even during a cutscene (MH4U was able to run multiplayer cutscenes fine, and that was on a 3DS).\n3. Revert decorations as craftable goods rather than appraisal goods from RNG feystones. In it's place Charms should be given the RNG placement, as that would not affect gameplay as much, but is an option for those who are aiming for their \"perfect build\"\n4. Change the whole Arch Tempered difficulty system.\n5. More monsters. The game has a decade long list of monsters to reuse or take inspiration from. \n6. Make maps easier to traverse. I'm here for the monster, not so much the map. \n7. Make Astera/Seliana easier to move around in. I'm using a NVMe SSD so loading isn't the worst thing in the world, but when I played on PS4, the load times were unbearable. There is no need to make Astera 3 tiers tall. \n8. Include G-Rank/Master Rank during release, \"super high rank\" is not fun at all. \n9. Weapons and Armor need to look better, or else there is no additional incentive to spend time to get it. It seems like Capcom understood how bad some of the armor looks and so added Layered Armor. \n10. This one is a personal request, but I feel more rewarded for my individuality as a hunter in the story, so I detest the Handler constantly annoying my character in the middle of hunts or after hunting. In the end, Monster Hunter is just a badass dude who has a lot of shit to do, not some jolly \"pard\" ready to save the world from some big baddie monster.  \n\nIt's a fun game with some glaring flaws, but I'm still here and I'm still playing, so good shit Capcom...

I have seen multiple MH games before and always found those ugly or borderline ridiculous. Smoll pipl swingin' big Club-shaped swords at giant monsters.... Huh? Really? Then I tried MHGU demo and was completely and utterly repelled from ever picking it up... Until I've seen a friend of mine stream MHW. I found both  the graphics and gameplay engaging and decided to buy this game while on sale. The beginning was slow... Running around, looking for some mythical turtle... Oh well... Then the High Rank hit hard. That was something amazing, now I had to fire SOS and call for help, now I could not just rush through the fights solo like I used to and that was the point where I found it so much fun. interacting with other players, having those moments of terror when some of your teammates, let alone you, gets stunned while having aggro. Rushing to teammate or being rushed to to prevent fainting and then mass fainting, both stunned and the one rushing for help... Love it. Every second. And it does not ever feel unfair. You die - your fault (does not apply to Hunting Horn, keep up the great work, I am looking at you, Longsword...). And then out of nowhere the game decides you are no longer a baby and throws Pickle and Bomberjet at you. So not only do you get slam-jammed by a pickle, but also get blown to pieces (keep a big pile of sh*t in your inventory).

(Arch Tempered System)\nArtificial difficulty content which adds almost nothing new fight wise for most of the end-game content in the game. \nGame does not explain in-depth mechanics which are key to understanding how the game works. \nConnection issues which make me want to strangle a Dodogama. \n\n[h1][b]Review:[/b][/h1]\n\nMonster Hunter: World is the 5th game in the main series of Monster Hunter, if you ever wanted to get into the franchise this is the best game in my opinion to try. But I do recommend you have a friend to play with or just someone who knows how Monster Hunter works. This game does not hold your hand and gives you the information in your \"Hunter Notes\". \n\nThis was my first entry into Monster Hunter and I'm glad I picked it up, Capcom did a good job in making it easy for new players to come along but a decent enough challenge for experienced players. There is so much to do but it isn't intimidating or a chore to do for the most part. \n\nFor the most part you can just view the story as a \"it's there\" sorta deal. I tried to enjoy what it gave but it didn't give me much to enjoy, except the cutscenes with the monsters involved, they really set you up for what you have to deal with, they're beautifully done and most monsters are enjoyable and don't feel like bull crap when you face them.\n\nAll the weapons in this game feel different, no two weapon feels similar at all, leading into different ways to approach the task at hand. Do you go in with a massive slow heavy hitting sword or shoot it to death with arrows? It's all up to you to decided how you want to do, just have fun it is a game after all. \n\nEndgame wise this is where I have my nitpicks with, it becomes nothing more than a grind. Sure you can bring friends to have fun and take your mind off it but for me it got annoying, decoration farming can be done very quickly and there are some events that make it easier to get more. However there is a siege monster which is strongly recommended you face in a group working together is the worst case. The fight itself is fun, for the first few times but it get stale and when you grind it 50-100+ times and still don't get what you want is frustrating. There is no pay 2 win bypass which is a blessing, but there is no other way to trade in parts of the monster to get the weapon you desire so badly. \n\nThe worst part about endgame in this game for me personally is the Arch Tempered system. It is meant to be very difficult to do and is reserved for the strongest monsters the game. For a majority of them they do nothing different for the most part, only a select few change it up if not at all. They add more health, more damage and change mostly nothing at all. There are good boys and good girls in the AT system but more bad boys than good. \n\n\n[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]\n\nGo play the game, it's fun with friends and makes for some great giggles and just a great experience, just wish Capcom would stop the awful excuses for content. \n\n\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54553195", "timestamp_created": 1565455307, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580088581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 767, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 52605, "steamid": "76561198131107077", "num_reviews": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1565455307, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "You beat up monsters\nYou skin them and forge gears\nYou beat up more monsters\nYou skin them and forge better gears\n\nIn the end...

Don't like the sword and shield?  Try one of the others, any really, they all play so differently than each other that there's something for nearly everyone in there - Light Bowgun and Heavy Bowgun are the only ones that feel like you're playing even close to the same weapon, and even those have some basic and noticeable differences.\n\n- Content.  Between getting your dream armor for looks, to getting that perfected set, for damage, there's a lot to do after the story.  Even when you feel finished, you might find yourself wanting to build a new set for a weapon you want to pick up.  After that, there are plenty of event quests that rotate on a regular schedule, and then on special festivals even more event quests come along.\n\n- Community.  For the most part the community is very helpful and friendly - I've yet to encounter a rude player, but then I've also not encountered everyone.\n\n- Connectivity.  I only include this because though having a good connection to the game is expected for most, this needs noting as part of the rumors that kept me away for a while was the terrible connections so many people were having to friends as well as to just the servers in general.\n\nAnd now on to the\n\nCons\n- Grind.  Though there is plenty of content to go through and getting that armor set or weapon or Warrior's or Hero's stone you've been after feels fantastic, getting there can sometimes feel like you set a stone wheel spinning and have placed your face directly onto the surface.  Fine if you don't mind a grind, especially ones that can be (slightly) mixed up from time to time to stop it from feeling too old, but not for those who hate having to grind for their armor.\n\n- Hunter Ranking.  This is on there because, even though up until about 140 (I think) you get rewards, eventually the HR level is...pointless.  About all it does after a certain point is show how many hours you've put into the game, there's nothing extra for reaching those upper levels of 900+ besides personal satisfaction, which kudos if that's your thing.\n\n- Events.  Events are the spice of life for this game - don't get me wrong.  From Extreme Behemoth to Kulve Taroth to Greatest Jagras, they're great!  But...they have a major downside.  Events are rotated in and out and even then some events are bound to certain festivals/times of year, which is a major bummer for people who want something from those.  And even for the ones that rotate in and out, if you fail to get everything you want from an event before it ends, it can easily be several months before you get another shot.  The only thing more infuriating than a grind is a grind you want to do but can't because it's locked away.\n\nAll in all, I do have to recommend this game.  Even with it's faults, it's a great way to just go in, feel powerful, face wonderful monsters, and just generally have a good time.  So if you're interested, come in, join the community, get your butt kicked by something you love, or love to hate, and hunt yourself some monsters.\n\nHappy hunting!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "51352818", "timestamp_created": 1561106649, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580056779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2579, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 57907, "steamid": "76561198007950785", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1561106649, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Impulse buy.\nDon't look back. \n...Never look back. \n500 hours later and I still don't know how deep this rabbit hole is.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "51326764", "timestamp_created": 1560994909, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578576176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 34502, "steamid": "76561198035712182", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1560994909, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "I'm really a fan of this game ever since it started on PSP more than 10 years ago.\nNow that it's on PC, a lot has improved and I can say that the lesser monsters are easy but the arch tempered elder dragons are not.\nSince my friends do not play this game, I usually play multiplayer via Respond to SOS.\nThe mechanics are nice since you are able to play (co-op) with random people.\nWhat I don't like about it is that the host (player who fired the SOS) can disconnect you anytime.\nWhat I hate about it is that for harder quests (AT elder dragons), some hosts abuse this \"power\" by disconnecting other players when the monster is about to die. AT Elder dragons for multiplayer are still very hard to kill alone even when they are about to die because HP is still set for multiplayer and your lone damage becomes insufficient.\nI hope something can be done about this \"power\" like limiting it to half the time of the quest or the state of the monster.\nIt's really annoying, frustrating and disappointing when you participated well in one quest for a long duration and the host just kicks you out for no valid reason.

This game fixes so many issues that the monster hunter series has had since its creation and really opens it up for newer players.\nMy only issue with this game is how tedious the endgame is. Once you finish the story mode which is a good 100 ish hours of gameplay your gameplay consists of just grinding out the same set of monsters that will give you the gem you want and hoping to god that you get it. the drop rates are pretty bad and you need multiple to make a good set. Then with these gems and your perfect gear you fight monsters that you've already fought thousands of times before that are just a little harder.

If not, it can get a bit frustrating if they keep on dying, since the amount of lives are shared by the whole party.\n\nThis game is for people who enjoy boss fights, mix maxing skills to counter the mechanics of the monsters and exploring the world.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "49152756", "timestamp_created": 1550831532, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579431511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 24043, "steamid": "76561198179522957", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1550831532, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "what a nice game\ni recommend it for u guys", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "49068910", "timestamp_created": 1550478978, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3265, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 20483, "steamid": "76561198378148028", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1550478978, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "This game just smacks you in the face every times you go \"Hahaha i got the best gear i am OP now\" by only making the game harder.

Getting started is a little bit slow and learning new monsters can be incredibly frustrating, but it is immensely satisfying once you finally learn a monster's attacks and down it, only to go back to the base and spend all of those hard-earned bones, hides, and other miscellaneous pieces on a sick new piece of armor or weapon upgrade.\n\nEasily worth the full $60 pricetag, and I would recommend this to anyone who might like a mash-up of games like Diablo and Dark Souls with a sprinkling of fighting games.

Where do I even start ...\n\nI've always loved the Monster Hunter series ever since I was a wee lad. I played a lot of the Monster Hunter games, with the exception of 4, 4U, Frontier and Generations. So needless to say, I've had plenty of time to get bored of the game.\nBut it never really happened.\n\n[b]Pros :[/b]\n- Graphics are nice, just detailed enough to catch your eye without distracting you too much.\n- The gameplay is fantastic, as it has always been.\n- The weapons feel great. Each has a unique playstyle.\n- Each monster you hunt feels unique (with a few exceptions, like the variants)\n- Unlike the other MH games, the environment here is completely open, with no loading time in between zones. This makes the gameplay feel smoother, and also makes it more tense (since you can't just bail out of a zone to heal in combat)\n- A ton of quality of life changes. Namely auto-crafting, being able to move while drinking potions, no more blademaster/gunner armor sets, etc...\n- Layered Armor ! (Vanity armor, basically)\n\n[b]Cons :[/b]\n- The game can get very repetitive, especially end-game content.\n- Even though the monsters are very well made, there's not a whole lot of them. As of now, there are 31 in MH:W, as opposed to 71 in MHGen.\n- The weapons and armor lack the great designs we've seen in the past, and feel bland and common (with a few exceptions)\n- Layered Armor isn't Transmogrification. Which means there are only few sets, as opposed to unlocking every armor you craft as layered armor. (but there is a mod to fix that, I believe)\n\n[b]And the most important con :[/b]\n- The game isn't for everyone. \n\nSome people can find the gameplay clunky at first, since there is no way to cancel an attack, but you pretty much have to treat this game's fighting as Dark Souls. Observe your enemy, commit to an attack, back off, rinse and repeat. (Unless you play some of the faster weapons, in which case you completely skip the \"observe\" part and go all out, dodging out of reaction time and prediction.)\nThe game is also a constant grind to get better gear. But thankfully, just like Dark Souls, the game isn't bound to \"Meta\", and is only limited by your own skill. You hunt anything with any weapon (as long as you do enough damage, since there's a time limit to your hunts). Your playstyle is never NOT going to work, but there are varying degrees of success, obviously. But you're never forced into anything. (unless it's Behemoth ... fuck me, that thing is strong)\n\nAnd if the game starts being boring ? Just hunt with friends. They fixed the servers, it's fine now. Hunting in this game is much more fun with pals, trust me. I've beaten the end-game, but I still find reasons to come back. Because my friends make this game feel more fun. \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this game, if \"thriving for improvement\" is your thing. If you feel like you're having a hard time, remember: This is the easiest Monster Hunter game. Have fun !\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] : The game's fun, even more fun with friends, combat feels good, weapons feel good, monsters are well made, (but it's quality > quantity), weapon designs got bland, lots of QoL changes. Definetly worth the price, even more so if it's on sale.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47823839", "timestamp_created": 1545793083, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580111275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4481, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 34430, "steamid": "76561198126234005", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1545793093, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "DODOGAMA 10/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "47802924", "timestamp_created": 1545736970, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579489492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2817, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 16581, "steamid": "76561198162843457", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1545736970, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Technical issues:\n\nBefore getting into the actual review, I feel that I would be lying if i said this game is completely done baking, but how many multiplayer games ever are in all honesty.  In my personal experience, I've only ever had two crashes, and those were some time ago. One, when I was fighting a kushala doara in the rain. The compounding weather and special effects resulted in a \"graphics device crash.\" I closed the game, updated my drivers, and have fought numerous Kushala's in the rain since. So it would seem the issue is resolved. My pc isn't exactly a NASA quantum computer, but my 1050 and my intel processor can run world at around 30 frames on lower settings pretty well. I have ambient occlusion on with the rest of my things on low, (because it gives the game more tonal variance) and the game still looks amazing. But anyway, capcom aren't masters at pc game development, and sometimes it shows. Overall not that big of an issue for me though, and should only be getting better from now on. I still would have rather gotten the game premature than have waited any longer for the release.\n\n\n\nActual game:\n\nI have been hunting monsters for a few games now, one was an actual entry and the other was generations, a kind of passover project to buy time for the development of the collossus of a game that nobody would have even imagined the series could become; Monster Hunter World.    Every single monster hunter game i've played has had seemingly endless playtime value, I managed to get up to 200 hours in 3 ultimate and 500 hours in generations. I'm still mastering world past the 300 hours mark at the moment. \nA large reason for the replayability of the monster hunters is how many different weapon classes there are; fourteen wildly different weapons to learn, with different playstyles for every one of them. I could go into all the different items you'll use or weapon types and subtypes, but this is not supposed to be a game guide, lol. Just know it's more than you'll probably ever get around to.\n\nEnvironment:\nEvery monster hunter game i've played has featured beautiful environments that functioned as the perfect sandbox to create almost whatever battle you wanted. World has taken this, and quadrupled it. I'm not sure if theres a single other game out there with map design that can rival monster hunter world. Just one expedition into the ancient forest and you will understand, the game feels real. The environments seem organic, yet they're perfect arenas. Openworld isn't quite correct, because you'll really only go someplace when you have a quest there, but it is an option to just go out to whatever area you want, find a random monster wandering around minding his own business, and end its life, or even capture it! Expeditions are not the economical decision, but if you're a savage that enjoys that kind of thing, you'll have a field day with this game. Even I find myself doing them every once in a while.\n\nQuests/Storyline: \n\nThe premise of the game is that you're a settler/researcher who has chosen to come to a newly discovered land in search of adventure. You will find it. The story, while seemingly tedious, is an important tutorial for the actual game, which you'll get around to after clashing twice with an enormous volcano tortoise, (a fight that can be fun, can be tedious, but you don't need to do it too much anyway) and slaying a colossol newborn dragon that could potentially destroy civilization. While not exactly the most engaging thing ever to a veteran like me, the fights were cinematic and intense. The monsters included can be challenging for newcomers. The story is really a tutorial, but don't get me wrong; There is noticable effort put into the plot. Some characters you may like. As a cynicist, i found a lot of them annoying, but still, characters like the chef or the admiral i had to have respect for. I mean, I'm pretty sure the admiral fights monsters bare handed. anyways~\n\nEndgame:\n\nWhat you'll be spending most of your time playing if you choose to truly give the game a chance.\n\nWhen you finish the storyline, you'll probably have 1, maybe two equipment sets. That's cute. at 300 hours, I have around 50 sets, about which half i actually use. There are so many different playstyles this game has to offer, and every one of them makes the experience feel new in an undeniable way. You'll make a set for dishing out damage, a set for paralyzing, a set to take damage, a set to recover health, a set to evade, a set to heal your teammates, a set to buff your teammates, sets just for collecting materials, and sets i'm not thinking of, the possibilities seem endless, and most of these you'll have different ones for different weapons, and you'll end up with unique blends of armor skills to suit your playstyle. And when you have it all built, you'll find yourself teaching others while waiting for the ENORMOUS EXPANSION COMING NEXT FALL. That is if you manage to get through all the event quests and new monsters that the game throws at you.\n\nGameplay:\n\ndisclaimer, if you're playing with default settings, of course you're doing it wrong.  I prefer my camera as far back as possible, of course auto-sheathe off, and some other bs i'm sure you can figure out.\nAlso, there are a number of mods that enhance the game, make navigation easier at home base, change textures around, put light pillars off of items, adjust decoration drop rates to reasonable numbers, reduce the bloom of the scoutflies, things that are just no-brainers. As far as I know, there haven't been any bans to date. I would highly recommend modding.\n\nMany people try to play Monster hunter like other games, mistaking the point to be to collect as many pieces of equipment as possible, but this is wrong. If you play it like this, you will never truly experience the satisfaction the series has to offer. Monster hunter is about developing your skills as the player: knowledge, and instinct. If you open your mind and pay attention to the virtual world immersing you, you'll discover that what you're actually playing is not a free for all monster bash, but rather a fast paced turn based game with some obvious and some not so obvious shortcuts. If you refuse to bend, you'll break. But once you learn to dance, the world becomes yours. \n\nMonster hunter is first and foremost an action game, but it allows you to come at it in nearly any way you could imagine. It's a game that will test you as the player, rather than just your gear; that diablos tyrannis is no use to you if you get swept up in the monster's rythm and miss all your big moves. \n\nConclusion/TL;DR:\n\nIf i were to ask of anything from the game, (besides better optimization) it would be more monsters, and the developers are working their butts off to bring us just that. So all we really have the right to do is to say thanks and wait patiently for more, because it's been coming and still is. I'm just grateful that theres no pay to play aspects in the game whatsoever, even as the series has gone to the big leagues, all dlc is truly cosmetic. \n\nYes, I would absolutely recommend the game. If you like an honest challenge that comes in a gorgeous package, theres really not a whole not of competition. Monster hunter is the trailblazer of it's genre, as well as the best in class. Like a slightly more forgiving nature themed darksouls or something.

It was plagued by numerous issues concerning lacking visuals, bugged visuals in cutscenes, constant connection issues, and more. Now, while the odd issue pops up every now and again with content releasing for the first time on the PC version, it has gone above and beyond in regaining consumer trust in my opinion.\n\nI was always going to play it. I don't own a PS4 and Nintendo seemed to have every other MonHun title on its platforms which I haven't owned since the Wii U. Where as I had thought we'd see simultaneous Wii U and 3DS releases, we got the one in MH3U and everything else went to the 3DS. With Monster Hunter World, we have a modern adaptation of a game series I've been in love with since 2004. With beautiful locations, monsters, and a ton of quality-of-life improvements, Monster Hunter World is the best in the series I've played so far. Keep in mind, I've only managed the first on PS2, the PSP games following it, and MH3 and MH3U on the Wii and Wii U. Were I blessed with a Switch I would definitely be spending equal time in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.\n\nThe only real downside here is the emphasis on mixed sets which without layered armor tend to look goofy, and the poorly implemented RNG method of obtaining decorations. In prior games, at least as I observed, you'd choose a baseline set with points towards skills you like and them you'd slot in decorations and use charms to empower the existing skills are add new complimentary or utility skills. All while looking great in a full set of matching gear. There were mixed sets in that era as well, but nowhere near as prevalent and meta as they are in MHW. Though the constant updates offering varied layered armor sets allow you to look good and perform well. The decoration system is unfortunately the one black mark on the game. I'm sure it will come in a future G or Ultimate expansion to the game, but Tempered and Arch Tempered monsters as a replacement for a full-fledged G Rank series of quests with new monsters and subspecies is... well, par for the course actually. MonHun has been adding expansions to base games and selling them anew since the first in 2004, so it's not too surprising, just still disappointing. Having to rely on RNG for decorations is an absolute bore, though.\n\nThat said, those are the only negative aspects I can think of for an otherwise unforgettable experience. Aside from Azure Rathalos of course being a constant asshole but that's what Flashpods are for. The combat is varied and skill-based, with a different tempo and method to defeating each beast based on your class of weapon. Movelists have been expanded since my time, adding over the top special moves that will knock monsters over, sever their tails, and break their horns! The core gameplay of slaying progressively stronger, larger, and more fearsome monsters while using the body parts of your slain foes to craft and improve weapons and armor is as addictive and rewarding as ever. New investigation quests allow for extra reward slots of varied rarity to close the gap in your hunt for rare parts. Each map is a near labyrinth of ups and downs, twists and turns, with hidden alcoves and tunnels only you can access. These maps are filled to the brim with collectables and pets for your room back at base. Literally stuffed full of useful items for crafting tools, weapons, and armor. Monsters clash with each other like never before in turf wars to decide who's the biggest and baddest. It's all just so damn cool to see coming from the prior era of Monster Hunter.\n\nAs my play time will show, I love this game so very much. Breached HR100 and there's still so much to do. So many weapons, armors, and decorations to collect. So many sets to build and improve for my favorite weapon types. So many upcoming monsters and AT variants with layered sets, event quests, and more. The fun won't end for a long while, so I hope you'll give this game another chance if it turned you away during the initial release.

There will always be a \"want for more content\" and hopefully there will be more in the future to come. However, for what it is, it is worth it. \n\nOne of the things I like about this game would be the way it created the feeling of mass and gravity. There are so many little details that add to this, for example, the appearance of a heavy swing with your giant 2h greatsword feels like a heavy swing of a giant 2h greatsword that should be too heavy to carry. Or the staggered recovery from a well timed dodge with the subtle movements of your character recomposing his/her stance. Even the way your character walks and runs has a subtle and crazy way of adding to the feel of mass and gravity. All this contributes to making combat dynamic and fun because all of a sudden positioning, timing and observation of your target become important. Side note, I also love the Gajalakas and the way they sound in the game.\n\nOne of the things I dislike about this game is that hitting the end game plateau comes quick.

It often comes to the point were not the game itself gets reviewed, but it gets compared only to the PS4 Version.\n\nSure... especially in the two weeks after its release PC players encountered alot of connection problems (of cause me too).

Finaly being able to defeat the Zinogre felt like a life time achievement, grinding dozens of ours to get that one special item you need to finish a armour set or make that awesome looking badass hammer to crush more skulls with or teaming up with other players to hunt the most dangerous monsters out there! It still gives me a rush everytime I start up the game!\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say the same about Monster Hunter: World. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game but doesn't give me the same feeling as the previous games. After being hyped up for it and reading very good reviews I decided to pre-order the game earlier this year. I played it non-stop and was completely addicted once more and had an amazing experience playing. Still, I felt like something was missing.\n\nAfter some intense monster fights I reached the endgame, time to fight the elder dragons! Nergigante is one the best monsters ever created! It doesn't give you a chance to rest at all and after finaly killing it I felt relieved and drained from the fight. The other elder dragons also have a amazing fight but here does come my one of multiple problems with the game. \n\nXeno'jiiva. Yes, the last elder dragon in the main story. After seeing its cutscene I was so hyped up for the battle...! But then the battle starts and it becomes a very boring and straight forward battle with the monster. Easy to avoid, does a lot of the same attacks in a row and overall doesn't do anything special. It looks majestic though being the biggest monster in the main story if not the enitre game! The music for the fight is also very very very good and it adds a nice feeling to the fight. Of course, I don't have anything bad to say about his armour, its the most beautiful armour in the game.\n\nAfter this brief introduction, let's sum up the Pros and other Cons!\n\nPros:\n* [b] Graphics [/b]\nThe game looks stunning! Unfortunately my PC isn't able to run the game on maximum settings so I had to push it down to medium/low. Even on these settings the game looks pretty neat! And since the game seems to be a heavy thing to run, thats good new for the people who have budget PCs!\n* [b] Gameplay/Combat [/b]\nThe combat in this game is amazing. Very smooth movements, amazing weapon combos. Honestly, I don't have any complains about it\n* [b] Monsters [/b]\nSherlock, of course the monsters are great. It's a Monster Hunter game! Once again, CAPCOM did an amazing job on the design of them! My personal favorite design is in fact the Xeno'jiiva eventho the battle sucks, it gets saved by the design of the majestic beast!\n* [b] The Areas [/b]\nThe multiple areas are pretty fricking good! Again, nothing bad to say about the design at all! Ancient Forest can be a maze in the beginning but after a few hunts you can locate yourself pretty nicely through the forest.\n* [b] Armour Design [/b]\nI will seperate the Weapon and Armour designs in this review. The differents armour sets looks absolutely beautiful. You can instantly recognize what armour set belongs to what monster. Well done CAPCOM once again.\n* [b] Builds [/b]\nI really loved building multiple builds from multiple monster armour pieces. After being able to get a 95% crit on weak parts I was satisfied with my build! That's not my only build of course, I have multiple builds in my box and all of them are endgame viable! Figuring out if I need to sure Alpha or a Beta piece pulled me in more!\n* [b] Crafting [/b]\nThe crafting is amazing as always. Nothing to add, just awesome!\n* [b] Multiplayer [/b]\nThe multiplayer is great. Starting a hunt, sending out an SOS flare and people start joining instantly! I've had a few connection issues in the first week of release but never had any problems with it after. Good job once again CAPCOM!\n\nCons:\n* [b] Weapon Design [/b]\nOof... oof... oof... Weapon Designs... Yea, that doesn't sound good does it? Well, it shound't sound good. I was very disappointed with the designs. Many of them looks the exact same for the majority of the game. They finally change when you reach the second to last or last rarity of a path. This is something the previous MH games did right. I hope they will add more variety to the next games.\n* [b] Amount of monsters [/b]\nThe monster may look amazing but there aren't a lot of monsters. Only having 31 large monsters on release wasn't enough. Of course they added the beloved Deviljho and are about to add more to the game it, still the game felt over very fast because of this.\n* [b] Performance [/b]\nThe game looks awesome but game performance is something else. It's not very good all of the time. The Kushala Daora fight is suck a fricking pain in the ass when it drops all of his tornados and the FPS goes to shit. This frustratred me a lot. Also having some frame drops here and there were annoying sometimes.\n* [b] Difficulty [/b]\nTo me, the game is to easy. I am used to this hardcore experience, needing to bring everything with me on hunts, even whetstones! MHWorld just gives them to you and they can't run out! No need to bring pickaxes, no need to bring nets to catch bugs. These kind of features took away the hardcore experience for me.\n\n* [b] Conclusion [/b]\nMONSTER HUNTER: WORLD is a good game. Not flawless but it's a good PC entry for the series! If you are looking to get into the series, MH World is a good choice but it doens't reflect entirely what the series is about. Is it worth to buy the game at full price? For me it for sure was! If you are not sure, wait for a discount and buy it! \n\nThis was my first review on a game on Steam.

Some people still have problems with connecting and staying connected to friends for multiplayer (arguably the focus of the series), but I haven't experienced anything of the sort.\n\nMonster Hunter as a series has always been a little tedious and this game cuts out a great deal of that. This whole game, while still Monster Hunter at its core, greatly streamlines the experience without losing any of the appeal. It axes a lot of the grind for materials through various ways without removing the fun of tackling monsters to get the equipment you need to fight more monsters.\n\nProbably the biggest drawback to the game is the... let's call it the Japanese UI. For whatever reason, user-friendly and workable UIs don't seem to be the strongpoint of most Japanese developers. While I am totally used to this thanks to old Monster Hunter titles, Souls titles, etc. friends new to the series have expressed very valid criticsm of the way the game handles menus, information presentation, and controls. This also affects multiplayer connectivity in an obtuse way since it can be a hassle to get through the menus.\n\nProbably the biggest crime the game suffers from is first-title syndrome. Monster Hunter games have fallen into a pattern where the first game in a new generation is essentially a barebones version of what will come next. If the pattern follows, we will get something like Monster Hunter World: Ultimate which will include much more content in the form of monsters, equipment, locales, and maybe even new mechanics (bring back playing as a palico!!!). It isn't even necessarily the case that Monster Hunter World in its current form lacks content, but that people experienced with the series and familiar with the gameplay will be able to blaze through all of the hunts without much issue. Almost nothing has changed with old monster behavior while the new monsters--though cool--are not exactly breaking the mold.\n\nThis is a wonderful game that will give you a ton of fun despite its relatively minor flaws, but hopefully this title is greatly expanded upon in its current form, rather than re-released with new things packaged in as older titles in the Monster Hunter franchise have been.\n\nbuy it or you're as dumb as a gargwa", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46002481", "timestamp_created": 1542831659, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580040083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 657, "num_games_owned": 276, "playtime_forever": 19632, "steamid": "76561197969901028", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1542831659, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "being playing mosnter hunter since freedom unite  i hate consols mainly cause of forced buttons that you are unable to change and that i dont like the controler in general i have been playing monster hunter online a lot just to get that feel but that game is full with microtransactions that any mmo has \n\nthis game is a dream come true it did have some issues with fps and graphics but they were fixed with some mods quite easy which i recomend any person having trouble to look throw the mods  , i had stutering at medium graphics and now i can play on ultra fine , other than that the mobility given to the player is somthing that was always missing from the games pair that up with the broken hitboxes of older versions and this game is a godsent  add that they added a flashed out story and you got a perfect package \n\nthe game does have a small number of monsters compare to other games in the series but each time gens were changed the mosnters were few as it was a new sistem which is understandable \n\nnew mosnters thow are being added in updates and with moding im sure this will become one of the most filled games \n\nthe only bad thing i have to say is 2 things \n\nNo Fatalis we didnt get the chance to see the black dragon in all his new HD glorry \n\nand the handler please let one of the mosnters eat her", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45905785", "timestamp_created": 1542671404, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2779, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 51398, "steamid": "76561198197264355", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1542671404, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "reminds me of my childhood.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45818002", "timestamp_created": 1542241700, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580105305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4834, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 21805, "steamid": "76561198108219817", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1542241700, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "I don't understand why so many people are complaining that it's grindy at end game etc when they've played the storyline quest and have put 100 hrs+ into it.

Take down the big, bad monster and harvest every part. Use that to craft better gear, kill a stronger creature and harvest better stuff, et cetera. This simple formula gets carried by the interesting diversity of weapon mechanics and character builds on offer.\n\nI haven\u2019t played many games like this. I tend to steer clear of clumsy ports from console to PC and/or games that heavily show eastern roots. MH:W exhibits both of those things in a variety of ways. The dialogue, story, character appearance, emotes, combat, and more are rife with non-western influence despite what I estimate to be a decent effort at localization. Even the little hop animation your character does when grabbing a transport during area transition cutscenes sneaks in a K-Pop-esque move! This influence is neither good nor bad, just worth pointing out.\n\nAs for it being a console port, the game unquestionably favors controller input over mouse and keyboard, but thankfully you can get accustomed to and partially remap the (undeniably awkward) control scheme so that it better fits M+KB.\n\nThe game feels polished despite so obviously being a port. Very few bugs or glitches encountered from day one. The issues seem to be more at the design level than the technical. In terms of art and visuals it\u2019s a beautiful looking environment with lush landscapes and exotic critters, great and small. The soundtrack does its job well, but the right music doesn\u2019t always cue up at the right time.\n\nThe UI and many, many menus a player must navigate are not user friendly or accessible at first. It all takes time and exposure to become proficient with. Even then, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever feel fluid on M+KB. I\u2019ve yet to experiment with controller. The camera is a bit stiff, kind of fights you, and doesn\u2019t stop on a dime. System settings can mitigate this a bit, so be sure to look through [b]all[/b] settings and optimize from the start.\n\nMultiplayer and grouping are a huge pain. Rarely have I seen a multiplayer system more poorly designed and implemented than this, which is baffling when it could have been so much better. Total lack of explanation of systems, so you\u2019re more or less on your own figuring it out. Frequent disconnections, inability to connect or reconnect to other player lobbies, pointless restrictions on which missions can be played together, hassles over the simplest multiplayer activity such as getting into the same instance of an area to free roam. No shared space in the main hub where you can see other players outside of one small portion of town, in which a very limited range of things can actually be done. Pitifully small number of actions you can actually do to interact with others or express yourself, socially speaking. Just baffling!\n\nWhen you do manage to get a good multiplayer session going however, it\u2019s an absolute blast to play with friends. Many situations will scale difficulty based on the number of players present, which is critical to keep in mind. Some missions also can only be performed solo or with a max of two players. The normal cap is four players. It\u2019s nice to roll with a group because it will feel like damage output is comparatively lacking when solo. It just goes faster in a group (as long as everyone is contributing).\n\nThe single most impressive aspect of [u]Monster Hunter: World[/u] and the biggest draw for me is the sheer number and variety of weapons (playstyles) in the game. 14 distinct weapon types that each dramatically alter your style of play and approach to combat. I recommend not getting pigeon holed into one, but rather becoming proficient in several.\n\nThere\u2019s an equally interesting variety of dangerous monsters. Each of them has unique strengths and weaknesses. Sort of like the witcher Geralt of Rivia, you as a monster hunter must bring the right tools to every new encounter. That\u2019s the core of the fun here: learning your weapons and discovering what build works well against which critter. That said, you can essentially build an all-purpose general monster slaying character and never change a thing; but that\u2019d limit your potential (and the fun) significantly, not to mention leave you with little to work towards in endgame.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to hand it to the devs; with such different control schemes for weapons, this game forces the development of player proficiency \u2013 actual player skill. The downside I suppose is that it\u2019s a bit annoying and overwhelming to learn so much at the outset. This is why I stuck with three or four fairly different weapons.\n\nThe key to creating a build is not just weapon choice, but (arguably more so) skill choice. Skills are attached to specific weapons, trinkets, armor pieces, and jewels (that can be socketed into your gear). Certain armor lines also have set bonuses that provide totally game changing properties. You can render a particularly tough fight with a tempered elder dragon into an almost trivial affair if you bring precisely the right build! However, crafting the gear/skills to complete said build ironically often requires killing that very same creature it\u2019s effective against. Have fun with that!\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of RPG goodness to sink your teeth into when creating builds. Make a lightning fast, high elemental damage dual blades. Or a tanky, virtually cc-immune lance that can block every attack in the game. Or anything in between. Your strategy can take into account raw damage and defense, element type, resistances, status ailments, movement speed, dodging, blocking, healing, support, mounting and aerial capability, crowd control, item use, ranged and melee effectiveness, unique mechanics from set bonuses, and of course the attacks and mechanics of individual monsters. If you wanted to go off the deep end, you could create a build for every single encounter in the game\u2026That\u2019d take a while.\n\nCame in not knowing what to expect. Definitely wasn\u2019t sure about this one starting out, but I ended up having a really enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this be played with friends; still fun solo but I believe the experience is diminished somewhat without the group dynamic. In the next installment I hope the cute but weirdly human-like animal companion at least is a choice between dog and cat\u2026But those cat armors are truly the stuff of legend.\n\n-TIP: Proceed directly through the main story missions rather than farming or dallying too long on other content. The game flows better that way. You want to unlock high tier armor lines in good time so you know what to work towards. Doesn\u2019t hurt to complete optional quests as they come up along the way.\n\n-TIP: Armor upgrade spheres come often and easily (from bounties), so for Pete\u2019s sake use them on whatever you\u2019re wearing. Or you\u2019ll be squishy, very squishy.\n\n-TIP: If you find yourself short on currency due to crafting/upgrading weapons and armor, go to your item box and sell superfluous crafting materials for a fast source of income.\n\n-TIP: Optimize your entire game right off the bat rather than doing it halfway through the game and having to readjust. There are settings that improve just about every aspect of this game for PC users, and the developers continue to work post-launch towards PC optimization. For item hotbars, the F1 through F4 setting works better on M+KB than the radial menu.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45271883", "timestamp_created": 1539546334, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1561656461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 902, "playtime_forever": 10842, "steamid": "76561197975298584", "num_reviews": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1539546543, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "My Favorite Game Of All Time! \nIv'e been playing this kind of games since on PSP! \nBest Game For ME!!!!!\n\n This Game Must Be The \u201cGame of the Year\u201d Award\nbecause it has a best immersive gameplay, and a great gripping story... its well-crafted with armors and weapons, and mostly great design and graphics, and addictive multiplayer to help others who needed.

But every hunt will be completely different from the previous one. How? Well, in one hunt you might cart twice and have a hard time, on the next, you might absolutely rek the monster and in the next, hell, who knows?\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is, sometimes you gotta research or do some trial and error all by yourself, without someone telling you to, for things to properly work. You know, google some answers, monster elemental weaknesses, where to find what, what weapon is best for you against what monster, or even go with the classic social relationship, where someone you know, knows something you might not know and pass the knowledge further, which is pretty great.\n\nOverall, fucking awesome game.

Hunt Monsters. While at times it is a bit too obviously a console port with its incredibly awkward default keybindings or it not making use of the keyboard having, y\u00b4know, lots of keys, and making you first press one key to bring up your hotkeyd items bar and then another key to actually use something on it instead of having just one step for this or actually having changing bindings for the same actio thoughrout the game, left click for interacting with things in town and right click outside of town, what?\nNone of these things take away from the fact that it is great to finally be able to play a monster hunter game with my mouse and keyboard instead of always being forced to have to deal with a controller. That said I would certainly hope that in the future more effort is put into making the PC version of the game at least feel like they tried changing it somewhat to adjust for it not being on a console.\nAs for the gameplay, it is amazing to be able to fight the monsters on a big screen after several monster hunter games on the 3ds though after having played the ultimate versions of the previous games Monster Hunter World does feel a little bit lacking in the amount of monsters and would certainly be helped by having at least 5-10 more species or even just subspecies that are different enough to the current monsters. That said none of this takes away from the joy of fighting the monsters that are in the game currently.\nSadly despite all the good things the one thing I really haven\u00b4t felt much enthusiasm with in this game is the multiplayer. When doing the main story quests all players need to play solo up till a cutscene for most quests before abandoning and joining on one if they want to play together which is clunky to the extreme, in addition to this sometimes joining mid quest doesn\u00b4t work with people in your session and we\u00b4ve also had frequent disconnections in the first weeks after launch though these have since reduced. SOS weirdly seemed to work better than joining mid quest on fellow session members though that can bring in random people which you might not want if you just are looking to play with some friends. Especially as it can happen that these random people will use cheats to for example instantly kill the monster to be hunted which kinda ruins the entire point of the game. So all this leaves multiplayer a bit of a mixed bag.\nAll in all I would still recommend this game especially if you\u00b4re fine with playing single player part of the time as I have definitely thoroughly enjoyed it even with the rather low FPS my below minimum requirements PC managed to produce, but if you are mainly looking to play with friends do take into account that you may occasionaly have to deal with the game sometimes just being a bit of a pain for no reason.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44583753", "timestamp_created": 1536158663, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10389, "num_games_owned": 162, "playtime_forever": 93683, "steamid": "76561197999373821", "num_reviews": 30}, "timestamp_updated": 1536158663, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "use a hammer, become a beyblade or a rolly-polly. 10/10 can't stop spinnin'", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44582040", "timestamp_created": 1536152068, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8119, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 22545, "steamid": "76561198117404787", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1536152068, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Really fun game that got hammered for connection issues on launch, which have since been fixed. Most people who left these reviews didn't bother to edit them since the update. Other reviews claim the game deletes saves, which have been proven to be an issue with improperly maintained editions of Windows. If you're curious about whether you might be affected, there are a few threads in the discussion forum which can explain it better than me. My advice is to ignore any negative review focusing on these two.\nThere are genuine issues, such as unavoidable frame drops from certain particle effects and poor textures in higher resolutions. Cutscenes will keep you from playing through the story missions simultaneously with friends without dropping hunts and requeueing after seeing the cutscene play. NPC's are incredibly verbose and sometimes take five or more lines of dialogue just to access a barrel right behind them to pick up four mushrooms.\nThe problems that do exist in the game don't keep it from being great, or at least well beyond the score it has. There's enough content to keep you busy well past a 1:1 ratio of dollar to hour, which is my metric for purchases. You can easily go past that if you enjoy the endgame grind hunting tempered monsters. Content is guaranteed to keep coming, as Capcom has already announced that everything already available to consoles will eventually arrive on PC.\nIf you do purchase the game, don't forget to pet Poogie after you come back from hunts.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44576709", "timestamp_created": 1536119045, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1574601087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 245, "playtime_forever": 37295, "steamid": "76561198030336827", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1536119045, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Great Addition to the monster hunter franchise.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44559367", "timestamp_created": 1536023234, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1542772435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 25827, "steamid": "76561198102533032", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1536023234, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Shut up Handler", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44558842", "timestamp_created": 1536020042, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579275214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2055, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 18767, "steamid": "76561198065635827", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1536020042, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "TL;DR: Monster Hunter on PC, what else is there to say? Instabuy.\n\nAt 100+ hours into the game, I'd like to think I'd seen quite a bit of it, as I'm in the endgame. There's certainly a lacking variety of monsters, and network issues were abound early in the release cycle... then there are the performance issues (I have SLI 1080ti, and some of the elder's particle effects kill even my frames!) But honestly, these are things that have either been fixed (the networking issues) or will be fixed in the future (continuing content updates, optimization patches, etc...)\n\nHonestly it's a good game. All the PCMR idiots scream about Denuvo, lack of 21:9 launch support (still missing at this point and this affects me, but I don't care because the bars don't bug me) and various other gripes, but IMO its just a vocal minority REEEEEEEEEing about stupid things that don't matter. I bought at release, I weathered the storm with a bunch of my friends, and I've had a ton of fun with it. I'll continue to have fun with it. Plus all of this will have been for the better...\n\nWe've shown Capcom that MonHun on PC can be successful.

Having to put all the stress on the cpu makes for a lot of problems for me. When I'm playing a game I might pull up a video just to kill time, which is pretty hard to do when my cpu is always close to 100%. None of these problems made my experience (so far) less enjoyable.

I was mostly picking it up because several of my friends were definitely going to be playing it and figured I might as well get in when everyone else did. I didn't really expect to get sucked into it as much as I did. Everything this game does is over the top. From getting food from the the Cantine for some buffs, to the weapons, to the monsters. You can fight a electric flying squirel with a shield and a lance with a built in gun. Or a winged chameleon with a sword/shield combo that turns into a giant ax. You've got greatswords big enough to satisfy Cloud, Hammers, normal sword/shield and lance/shield, acrobatic glaives, giant katanas, switch axes, bows, light and heavy bowguns, and even a hunting horn if you fancy yourself a bard. I've only tried a few of the weapons myself (glaive, charge blade, and bow) but from what I've heard every weapon is viable.\n\nCombat is a nice mix of hectic scrambling to avoid the giant monster running you down, Quickly beating on it when you get the opportunity, and using actual tactics to open up that opportunity. Preparation will definitely help you out here- bringing flash pods to stun a flying monster out of the sky or screamer pods to force a diving monster to the surface will make your life easier. As will taking advantage of buffs like the meals and various potions.\n\nThe environment really feels alive as you have small creatures you can capture as pets everywhere, normal sized creatures roaming around, and then usually several of the bigger monsters roaming around. It's not that unusual to be fighting one thing only to have some other monster decide it wants in on the action. Sometimes you'll even find yourself in the middle of three of these monsters duking it out all at once.\n\nIf I was going to complain about anything it would likely be the UI. Something like the Foundry feels like it could be simplified down. It's a little tedious to open one menu, back out and go into another menu, over and over. This is especially common in the Smithy if you are checking upgrade paths or crafting and upgrading a new weapon. Similarly the layout of the city is a bit inconvenient- everything is just close enough that the fast travel might not be worth it, but most of the stuff you'll need isn't next to the fast travel anyway.\n\nAnother complaint might be that the combat feels a little more sticky than it needs to be at times. Some attacks will let you adjust your direction of attack, but most of the time if you start attacking in a direction you are stuck there until you manage to get out of the animation lock and wait for your character to turn around.\n\nIf you like boss style monsters and oversized weapons this game is definitely worth a shot.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44294902", "timestamp_created": 1534863046, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580094407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3798, "num_games_owned": 363, "playtime_forever": 33690, "steamid": "76561198016588127", "num_reviews": 32}, "timestamp_updated": 1536939348, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "This game comes with hard mode.

I absolutely hate it. A game with a main focus of multiplayer with some past iterations requiring multiplayer for High Rank hunts with server issues being this bad for this long is embarrasing. I played this game on xbox since release and the only main issues with multiplayer occured during the first week but it was fixed. It's been longer than that here on this platform. Let me review the game and you should be able to determine why I have a negative review here.\n\nMonster Hunter: World content wise is an absolutely incredible game and taking into consideration all the past MH games this is the best MH game ever released. Many elements of the game are streamlined including the tracking, questing, and general hunting which in this case is one of the best things this series could have done to attract the western audience the way it has. The game is very gripping and can pull hours and hours away from you on the endless hunt and grind for better weapons and armor and eventually even more as you progress through the game. However an important element of the MH series is the multiplayer which has been absolutely terrible on PC. With little communication or information on the issues we have a measly 2 announcements from Capcom saying they are \"Working on it\" with valve. It's even beginning to screw with me because I enjoy doing end game content with friends and people online. Its how I've played every Monster Hunter prior. And to not be allowed to do that without major issues is beginning to turn me off from the PC version and making me want to head back to my HR250 character on xbox but I really don't want to do that. I want to play the version of the game that all my friends play on. I mean its a problem when 300000 people are playing and I can't find any body to play with. Terrible. \n\nNot to mention how lightning weapons cause massive frame drops. I maintain 100 fps on custom setting at 1440p with a GTX 1080 and i7-6700k. Why does my game drop to 20fps when my buddy is using a lightning focused weapon? This is another issue with the game that needs to be addressed. \n\nAlso how the game has an issue with an endgame cutscene that has the chance of fully corrupting your save. No recovery available. You have to restart. Thankfully you can access your save game with ease and make backups. There are even scripts on reddit that autosave and backup for you. Please use those before you enter the final boss of the story. I dont want to see fellow hunters turned off by a corrupt save that makes you lose potentially 30+ hours of progress. Stay safe hunters.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that cause me to give a negative review. Once fixed you can fully expect a 10/10 from me. But even I must be a critic of my favorite game series. \n\nScore until fixes: 4/10 \n\nOf course I will personally keep playing the game. I love this game. But for a potential buyer maybe wait out for a bit until these are fixed.\n\nEdit\n\nGame is fixed.

It's also very large and had to cut it to fit, and eventually gave that up and just put in a link.\n\nThe benefit of playing a port months after the game initially hits consoles is that there are a host of guides available, which I recommend if you want to take this game moderate seriously (bit of an oxymoron there but bear with me). I don\u2019t typically like games that require you to have extra study material to understand but to its credit, all I had to do was watch one video guide about the mechanics of my favored weapon, the Light Bowgun. After which I was probably fifty percent better every hunt after that. So I certainly recommend looking into that.\n\nThe story begins with your highly customize-able character on a ship to a \u2018new world\u2019, previously undiscovered in other games of the franchise. Your ship gets waylaid by a mountainous \u201cElder Dragon\u201d who came up from sea. His back is full of magma and volcanic spouts and you climb his back in order to escape. Once you\u2019re in safety, you find out he\u2019s one of many that have migrated to this place for mysterious reasons. Typically one every few hundred years, now it\u2019s one every decade and that has caused some turmoil in the ecosystem. Your job is essentially research. Kill monsters, stabilize the ecosystem, and arm yourself while doing so.\n\nEventually there is an extended epilogue. Once you discover that Elder\u2019s goal and what it might mean, you enter a \u201cHigh rank\u201d hunt mechanic because the ecosystem has changed and you react accordingly. Monsters in these quests are tougher and more aggressive, and you continually work your way up.\n\nMy immediate first impression of MHW was actually quite positive. There\u2019s something I can do here that I never really could at Dauntless; actually solo monsters. Dauntless was fairly unforgiving, only giving you five (count them: five) potions per hunt. You burn through those without burning the monster down properly, and you were done. Mercifully here, you not only get dozens of varying degrees of usefulness, you can also craft more on the fly or withdraw some from your loot in various camps set up around the impressively large zones. While some monsters give me more trouble than others (most flying types can do a one-two knockout by rushing me, putting me in a twelve hour stun animation, then merely swipe at me for an instant death), I\u2019ve been in awe at what I\u2019ve actually been able to accomplish on my own.\n\n\u2026And unfortunately, I am forced to do a handful of things on my own. Let me tap into some of the problems I have before diving back into the meat and mechanics of the game. Steam reviews are mixed for a couple of reasons. Bad controls and connectivity issues. The bad controls are a remnant of the fact that it was originally a PS4 game and the menus really show that. The UI itself is very controller friendly while the M/K is barely given a second thought. I had to rebind my weapon draw to left click like it is with melee because I\u2019d find myself engaged in too many fights, frantically clicking only to find out I was actually just using my slinger and tossing useless rocks at the monster. In addition, the radial menu might as well not exist, as it is bound to your various F1-F4 keys. It\u2019s very clunky and not at all the \u201cquick\u201d menu that it\u2019s supposed to be. Frankly, I\u2019m tired of hearing \u201cjust get a controller\u201d from my friends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve touched a controller since 2008.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct party system, just player listings and hubs. You have to find a convoluted \u201cSession ID\u201d in the menus for your friends to copy and eventually join together. Someone posts a quest and everyone joins it. You won\u2019t physically see anyone outside of a hunt unless you visit the gathering hub on top of the main town. The whole Session ID is just a pointless extra step that the likes of Capcom just love throwing in there. I am reminded of Black Desert Online. Despite being a different country, it still has the same idea behind its mechanics. \n\nOne does not simply just craft or buy potions. First you have to press thirteen buttons just to get a stack of them. Then they might be put in your storage box, not personal pouch so you have to remember to take them out before your hunt. Then there\u2019s the canteen mechanic, where you\u2019re encourages you to eat to gain decent buffs before every hunt. Why not make that a single item you can use midhunt? Like Dauntless, pretty much every important thing in town is far apart and forces you into miniature loading screens. After every hunt you\u2019re plopped on the bottom level but you still have to run up to the Blacksmith to fetch some upgrades. One does not simply make armor, too. In the higher levels you have to micromanage \u201cdecorations\u201d to socket into your arms and armor to increase various passive skills. Why not just make those skills up-gradable like the armor itself? Indeed, one does not simply upgrade their armor! You have to collect \u201cspheres\u201d that you get from bounties and hunts in order to do so.\n\nEverything just has a pointless extra step, but I admit these are all nitpicks in what I do believe is a pretty damn good game. I have adjusted to the controls (even though it takes twelve clicks to get anywhere in the menu, but the combat is fine) and I can stomach the connectivity problems\u2026 for a time. Everything else is just a niggling annoyance that I have to deal with before I get to the real heart of the game: Expeditions and hunts.\n\nTo its credit there\u2019s a lot to do. Expeditions are the closest thing this game has to an \u201copen world\u201d setting. You will keep everything you acquire, gather materials and hunt the local monsters at your own leisure (though once you attack, they enter a sort of timer where they will flee the area if you fool around too much, but the mode itself will never kick you out). You can pick up quests on-site and continually remain in the zone you\u2019ve chosen. Admittedly I haven\u2019t explored expedition mode to a severe degree, as doing the various optional quests and bounties give me more than enough gameplay on their own. I never really need to piddle around the same zone for that long.\n\nI mentioned earlier that I was happy that I can actually solo a handful of monsters in this game as opposed to Dauntless. There\u2019s a lot more to that, the \u201csimplest of MH\u2019s\u201d claim be damned, I embrace convenience if it comes hand in hand with actual fun. You can farm the same monster a few times but I found that the game offers you a handful of armor sets that can be crafted from bones and minerals alone. You can pick up bones from piles around every map and mine at little alcoves and continually gain materials to sets that will be perfectly passable for a time. I wore the basic \u201cbone\u201d armor for a while before getting into the more specialized stuff. Revered is the Anjarath, the game\u2019s T-Rex who has a fire breath attack that will absolutely one-shot you and serves as the game\u2019s first difficulty wall. His armor, however, gives fire resistance so if you can stomach fighting him a couple times (ideally in multiplayer), then you can likely build yourself up to handle him properly. Fun fact; I\u2019ve yet to solo him myself.\n\nOther monsters have given players trouble that have instead given me more fun. The Radobaan for example, a sort of mid-game encounter in a zone called the Rotten Vale. It is a place where many monsters go to die and their essence feeds the Coral Highlands above it. The Radobaan covers itself in the bones of dead creatures and is thus highly armored, and you must burn through that in order to do some raw damage. I know of players who find this armor annoying but his movements are highly telegraphed and he\u2019s a fan of stumbling himself which gives me a lot of free shots at him. So far he\u2019s honestly been one of my favorite monsters to fight.\n\nSee full review: zydrateacademy.tumblr.com/post/177106480599/review-monster-hunter-world-pc", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44217243", "timestamp_created": 1534544958, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1565382748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 479, "playtime_forever": 5475, "steamid": "76561198065343430", "num_reviews": 93}, "timestamp_updated": 1534545154, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "First off i'd like to point out that this game has been subject to many review bombings because Capcom releases content updates later on PC than on Console. These people often ignore the fact that basically any PC port of a console game will take more time, as you have to account for all the different hardware configurations of different users and the resulting possible bugs. Onto the review itself:\n\nMonster Hunter is a game series where you fight monsters to use their loot to make better weapons to hunt more monsters. It's fun, trust me ^^\n\nHaving played MHFU for about two thousand hours, i wanted this game. I wanted it BAD.\nAnd oh boy does it deliver: You get the classic Monster Hunter expierience in the core game, ever so slightly enhanced by new mechanics that overall fit the theme and the vibe of the game.\nYou get all 14 weapon types that have ever appeared in the series, along with new moves for every single weapon.\nYou get a ton of quality-of-life changes, most of which i think are useful in streamlining the game rather than making it actually more easy.\nYou also get something the game never had before (afaik): a cinematic storyline.\nThis could have been solved better, since the cutscenes somewhat hinder coop play when you have not done the quest already, but apart from that it's a nice touch and again, it fits the general vibe (somewhat).\n\nInitially this game ran like crap on my PC (i am fairly above the recommended hardware specs)\nAfter downgrading the nVidia \"not-so-game-ready\" drivers to the previous version (398.36) i now have smooth 100 fps at highest settings in 1080p, hence why i can now fully recommend this game to basically anyone.\n\nDisclaimer: I am aware of Denuvo, I am aware of the day-0 patch, i am aware of the poor performance, the heavy CPU load and the heavy connection issues which i still have myself. \nIf you are concerned about anything above then consider this please before buying. For me as a fan of the series, i simply had to buy this.\nFrom my perspective it is still worth the full price.\n\nUpdate: the connection issues are far less, since the game gets updated every few weeks, it also gets new content at a faster rate than the consoles did, one day the update cycle will be the same.\n\nAnother Update: Capcom continues to make the game even better, added better mouse support, even more enhanced graphic options and the game now runs smoothly on the newest nVidia drivers alongside a ton of smaller quality-of-life additions. It is a healthy mix between content and performance updates and there is no end in sight.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44212024", "timestamp_created": 1534524657, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579919576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2017, "num_games_owned": 172, "playtime_forever": 27349, "steamid": "76561198168029088", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1557467811, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "garbage servers with 5028f-mw1 disconnections everytime of the day,DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED\n\n21/8/2018 EDIT:they released a 150mb patch claiming to fix the disconnection errors,but still cant find a proper session to join in to,overall ruining experience,still DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED,smh cant believe they're ruining a veteran's wet dream over connection issues\n\nlate edit:they fixed it,plz buy the game it's a delight.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44206109", "timestamp_created": 1534505694, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575990620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 11698, "steamid": "76561198061647241", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1539695941, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Good game with high graphics", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44199177", "timestamp_created": 1534470647, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575217449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 386, "playtime_forever": 10047, "steamid": "76561198330209870", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1575217563, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "I don't know.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44198396", "timestamp_created": 1534466461, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1275, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 17550, "steamid": "76561198027110409", "num_reviews": 37}, "timestamp_updated": 1534466461, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "I'M TIRED of THESE ISSUES!

The game painstakingly (if not painfully) explains every new mechanic and aspect that is introduced to you as you progress, yet also gives plenty of breathing room for you to explore and experiment with gameplay mechanics on your own.\n\nFor those who have played the previous MH titles, you'll find this one provides a much easier, streamlined and less grindy experience overall:\n- Mundane activities (collecting whetstones, paintballs, making tools, etc) have been removed or simplified. \n- Environments now regenerate resources after a set amount of time.\n- Instead of paintballs, players now track monsters using a mechanic that allocates points for specific actions against a particular kind of monster (which is still rather tedious). These points accumulate and provide permanent benefits to the player.\n\nI already own MHW on the PS4, but I decided to buy it again for the PC. One of the easily noticable differences is that the PC version is not capped at 30 fps. Heck, you can go above 100 if your PC is beefy enough.\n\nAnother one is loading times. On the PS4, everything took at least 20-30 seconds to get through.

However, if this is your first game of the series, I strongly recommend against getting it.  To begin with, the tutorials are bad.  There are huge swaths of the game they don't bother to explain to you, including large parts of how the weapons work, and how the monsters forecast their attacks.  \n\nThe game greatly benefits from being played with a controller, however the controller integration with Steam is a dumpster fire.  Many, many times I was playing the game, and would pull up a menu only to get dumped into some sort of controller console.  It was a blank screen where nothing would respond to the controller, and their would be a single text box with a blinking cursor.  Additionally, frequently when trying to use menu selections to add another player, the controller would just stop working.  It wouldn't just require restarting the game, but exiting out of Steam altogether, and then starting Steam up again.    \n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, after several hours of play (well past the refund period), the game starts throwing challenges at you that require multiple players.  Which would be fine, if the multiplayer sessionmaking wasn't total garbage.  Sessions are constantly disconnecting, and as mentioned earlier, a lot of the functionality designed to let you invite friends just contain game-breaking bugs.  It takes a long time to get into a session, and once you finally do, and it disconnects, there is no way to reconnect; you have to leave the quest and start over entirely from the beginning, having to re-create the lobby, and re-invite the members of your party.  And if you're running story missions, you have to run halfway through the mission and get through the cut scenes before you're allowed to invite your friends, which you have to do from a hard-to-navigate dropdown menu in the middle of a monster fight.  \n\nIt seems like it might be a great game, but I put a ton of time into figuring out the basics to the point where I felt comfortable playing with other people, and then playing with other people was so plagued with errors and other mechanically problems that it's a miserable slog.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44137371", "timestamp_created": 1534236562, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1534225666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 423, "playtime_forever": 1132, "steamid": "76561197981834069", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1534570940, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "While I have played many hours of Monster Hunter World, and will continue to play I must say I cannot recommend it.

Combat is very methodical and punishing if you aren't learning the monster\n- Performs acceptably. From my experience playing on PS4, getting a around 60-70 FPS at max settings 2560x1440 on a 1080Ti. Turned down the volumetric fog from Highest to High to gain another 10 ish FPS without significant impact on the graphics\n- Great load times vs my time playing on PS4, SSD or no. The PS4 load times were a constant (minor) source of frustration\n\nNeutral:\n- Maybe not as optimized as possible, but personally I think the performance is adequate\n- Pretty CPU-intensive. I have an i7-6700K @ 4.4GHz and I'll get about 60-70% load on max settings. Manages to use more than 4 CPU threads, unlike many games. All 8 threads of my 6700K get involved\n- [strike]Mouse acceleration kills me on the inside, but I think it's partly balance. Being able to aim as swiftly as a normal mouse could be game-breaking[/strike] Oh, the sweet lord Raw Input has arrived, looking forward to giving m+k a go now that raw input is available.\n- The best UX in any Monster Hunter game (not saying much since the UX is still pretty painful at times)\n\nCons:\n- Missing some graphical options I wish were there (Primarily disabling depth-of-field and motion blur)\n- [strike]Networking issues are currently a moderately significant issue. Seems to be a bigger problem with matchmaking than with custom lobbies with friends, but issues still occur there. (they are looking into it, and hopefully resolve this). [/strike]\n- A Patch has been put out for the networking issues. I personally haven't had any disconnects since the patch, and I haven't heard of any issues from friends who play the game, so everything seems far more stable, and any networking bugs that remain appear to be fairly minor.\n- Disconnecting during a multiplayer match just leaves you in your hunt, but suddenly solo. No re-loading or anything, your monster is at the same %HP it was before your disconnect, but you're suddenly not in a group and fighting the multiplayer-HP version of the boss with your Palibro. You don't get kicked out of the hunt or anything, but it definitely sucks that the monster doesn't drop back down to the same %HP but with the Solo HP maximum. Generally not a big deal, but it sucks to restart your hunt if you D/C off the bat. Hopefully a minor inconvenience now with the new networking patch.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yeah, I would. Monster Hunting is a good time, and I think anyone who thinks they might like Monster Hunter will enjoy this game. Hopefully the networking issues are resolved quickly, since they're definitely the biggest problem.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44122920", "timestamp_created": 1534177445, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580097625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 926, "num_games_owned": 730, "playtime_forever": 7728, "steamid": "76561198008995821", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1537475374, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Not going to lie lost track of the days while playing this game and racked 80 hours in 4 days, I see a lot of people giving it neg reviews over the smallest reasons look here's a list of some pills you gotta swallow. \n\n1 - Gonna get this fat pill outa the way so listen Monster Hunter was never designed to be played with KB+M from the ground up it just isn't MH has always been that way years before the conception of PC MH was even a thing, HOWEVER that does not mean you cannot adapt to the controls scheme they already have. Instead of trying to change everything to fit you adapt to the games controls it'll happen eventually. A lot of people want to change them but they never try to just adapt to them like any games control scheme I can understand wanting to have some things be much easier to do but your fingers will learn and it won't be such a stiffiling experience then especially when you develop muscle memory.\n\n2 - On release the port was meh it did it's job and has it's functionality boom done (wording it for past tense because they're going to fix the PC port I don't see why they wouldn't but will change if they don't but even then it's really noothing to get bent out of shape for). Furthermore no PC port is ever perfect and this game isn't any different. The game IS NOT A BAD GAME by any means it's a a fantastic game with a meh port but can steam read that? No so you get thousands of neg reviews that pretty much are boggled down to \n - Lack of some visual options\n - Connection issues\nPersonally not affected by Denuvo don't care about it, Visuals are pretty solid some textures don't look great but when 90% of what you do is fighting monsters you never really have time to notice or see the texture flaws especially since the camera itself isn't on top of your character and is decently far back for you not to notice but i'm assuming they'll be fixed if not like I said earlier you don't really notice or atleast I don't. Connection issues I've DC'd twice out of my 80 hours so far 1 DC per 40 hours pretty much, I played mostly solo and grouped with friends on occasion and popped some SOS flares every now and again.\n\n\nPersonally as someone that's played previous MH titles this one sets itself a part is is a ton of fun to have, the game will be fixed it's only been 4 days since release at the time of making this review. In my opinion most of the neg reviews are people getting bent out of shape over multiplayer like they're not going to fix it.........well ofc they are going to fix it why wouldn't they. \n\nWould I reccommend this game? Well my play time speaks for itself. If you wouldn't enjoy jumping onto a dragons back stabing it's eyes in and then taking your massive Great Sword and slamming it and ripping it out of it's face causing it to fall out of the sky to your fellow hunters or maybe you enjoy a much more lucrative approach setting traps poisoning the monsters favourite meat with various types of ailments.

Then a lil text about my experience of the game / how it feels. \n\n[quote]Edit:\n+ i never had a crash or problem, not even a lag so far. I'm putting this here bc a lot of people wrote me asking about performance - its just flawless. Cant say anything else, i even tried streaming (to other people and between pcs etc), no problem.\n+ Controller support is great! PS4 or Xbox One both work (plus keyboard and mouse ofc), though the button icons will be set to either keyboard+mouse or Xbox controller. Controls are the same / same bindings as across the series - so if you played MH before, you'll be right at home :)\nI play with PS4 now mostly bc its way more comfortable than cheap ol' Xbox (even tho its an original one, *cough* just poor quality, microsoft *cough* <.<) and i didnt have any problem.[/quote]\n\ni'm at about 50h now, so far i can say....\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n+ familiar MH feeling\n+ a lot of (minor?) improvements in HUDs and Menues and Gameplay wich smooth out all the lil hickups the older games had, making a really solid and good base\n+ hunting and stealth aspects make the game much more interesting, so does the manuvering in the maps / open worlds\n+ really beginner friendly, tutorials are really well made and easy to understand - even the paching is great by handling you things over not to fast but also not to slow.\n+ Learning Curve is both good for experianced and beginner players this time\n+ uped the grafics (like MH tri)\n+ new poin system mixes it all together and you have rewards for every lil thing you do, wich feels just great!\n+ the lore is actually exsistent this time and is presented in a good to understand and interesting way\n+ as is the story. and i mean a real story, it has one this time. Maybe a bit light, but its there and its good!\n+ optional quests not only improve items, chefs kitchen/eating, weapons etc but aou now can also build camps and make it easier to travel and play on a map if you prepare and buold stuff up! You ahve to travel there before and find places where you CAn tho, wich is cool in my book bc its immersive, but might annoy people. - just look up a guide then.\n+ the grind actually got better, like in, you-can-get-quests-wich-higher-drop-chance-better ;) Its not too easy but also not too hard wich i apprichiate, having build Rathian set for what feels like the 100th time xD\n+ DLC / Patches are free as always ! i love you MH devs !\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- since so much had to be changed / fixed and of so many improvements (grafics, better story and tied-in monsters, open world, animations and movement quality) it does not have as man monster as other titles. You dont relly feel it tho, its not that much less then it might look on the paper. Its like with Tri / MH3U kinda - judging but what i saw myself and heared i would say you still got about 300h of content, so dont worry !\n- DLC from console does not seem to be implemented yet (?), but i guess its okay\n\n\n[h1]It feels like other monster hunter titles, but also it seems to be more than that. It seems to be what i and my friends always saw in MH. [/h1]\n[b]You really can feel like a Hunter, tracking monsters, doing research, building up camps and taming the land as you want - IF you want.[/b] Or you can just slay monsters and help out others, just jump an and have some team action on hard monsters (they get harder with more players ofc, but its also way more fun and the teamplay is, not counting rare hiccups, really great).\n[b]Also, solo is aboutsultely possible and fun! I actually swap between the two when ever i feel like it - no prob. [/b] Go in, do your thing if thats what you like. If you have trouble you can still decide to call fo help anytime tho-! Just great how fluent it works :)\n\n\nLike i said, might be the best Entry yet, but i still have a lot to see so i will stop here :P\n[list]\n[*]If you still are not sure, and you HAVe played MH, just buy it, you dont be disappointed, i swear!\n[*]If you dont know the frachise but are interessted - you should bring lot of time. Like i said 300h gameplay probably, and thats just when you do all monsters, you can grind quiete a bit on the way. Its a fun grind tho, not the forced, annoying one :D So yeah, think about giving it a shot :P \n[/list]", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44118083", "timestamp_created": 1534163868, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1683, "num_games_owned": 561, "playtime_forever": 19073, "steamid": "76561198036835055", "num_reviews": 59}, "timestamp_updated": 1534166122, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "big fan, great stress reliever", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44116430", "timestamp_created": 1534158207, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1572093542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 14203, "steamid": "76561198047748943", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1534158207, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "review": "Overall a stunning game that brings in the feeling of nostalgia from back when i was younger.

I was sceptical when they first announced MHW back in e3 2017 and I was like \"Really? A MH with realistic current-gen graphics?\"... But when it finally came to PC and played, it gave me a nasty surprise...\n\nTo put it simply, MHW is far more complicated than its predecesors but it's more user-friendly and more comfortable to play. The map now feels like an open world ish unlike area-based environment like it was, where the system needs to go into 3 seconds loading if the hunter moves into a new area. But when I say it's more complicated, I'm talking about the map design here; each map has different levels of ground, meaning roughly 1F to 3F you can access, also there are plenty of grounds to climb, more caves, as a result plenty of navigation to the map. Well that's one hell of a way to get lost rite? Not exactly... The scoutflies are there to help you, they're green glowing flies that guide you into your quest objective, several interactible objects, and also waypoint you put when you're accessing the world map and it just works like your personal GPS actually. The only problem for me at some quests is when I'm trying to find the large monster I needed to hunt. Because the world is larger, Capcom decided to make large monsters to leave tracks so that hunters can easily find them such as footprints, skids, etc. But unless I find one of them around, I need to travel around the big map until I find one unless I open up some online guides on where does the particular monster spawns.\n\nThe soundtrack is just simply outstanding, when you're fighting against a monster, the music just fits perfectly on how tense your battle is. When the monster is fleeing and you're chasing after it, the music also adapts into it, fiting into the atmosphere and flow of your game. The village theme in this game also simply become my favourite of the series, next to MH2 and MH4.\n\nBut that's just not the main point that completely sold me into the game here. Capcom completely overhauled the gameplay experience to make the game very comfortable to play. For instance the gathering mecanisms: hunters now instantly grabs herbs, mushrooms, or bugs instead of 3 seconds of animation per grab. Carving, bone gathering, and mining also alot faster, and on top of all, you can just hold the action button to gather until its resource vein completely drains out which makes gathering jobs a lot faster and ease which kept me wondering why only now these mechanisms are implemented because I was frustrated enough about gathering in previous monster hunter games.\nI used to search for online guides everytime I play previous Monster Hunter series because the game just simply not straight-forward. I need to research myself for the game mechanisms, monsters behavior, as well as guides and tips. But in MHW, the tutorials are way more sophisticated. There are also Research Center in this game; in short, every monsters has its own research levels which if you level it up, your hunter guide's information regarding to particular monsters will grow. It'll display their weaknesses, breakable parts, even dropped items.\nPotion drinking is a lot more risky; the hunter will start drinking potion immediately with a white bar in your HP gauge starting to regenerate into actual green bar (a.k.a your real HP). This process can either be cancelled by rolling or getting attacked by a monster. If this happens, the healing process will stop and your potion will still be consumed. The great news is, you can still move (or even run) at a slower pace will consuming. Which means, overall consumables became easier but at the same time risky if there are monsters around.\nArmor skills in this game are more variant than previous series. In the past, players need to have full set of armors in order to activate its armor skills. Here, each armor parts activates a skill. The difference are each skills have wider amount of levels which means if any other source of armor skills stacks the same skill it will level up, also some sets have unique armor skill bonuses if wielded with a full set.\nThe UI in this game provides more information as well. For the first time, players will be able to see damage indicator presented as numbers. The damage indicator will be white color if you hit fortified part of the monsters, while it will be red if you hit their weaknesses. Also with these numbers, hunters will know exactly how damaging each weapon classes differ. Another example of UI tweak is monster's heart rate. While this is not straight-forward, the heart-rate monitor tells you about the monster's state. While enraged, heart rate will increase and sometimes turn into orange ish instead of blue. While exhausted, heart rate will slow down; while weaken, the heart pulse will be smaller than usual.\n\nWell, moving on into my cons for this game, first of all the launch isn't that smooth. Multiplayer as for now isn't playable due to server issues, perhaps because players are too hyped, the game's player count reaches above 200.000 which may explain the server is overloaded. I tried to play multiplayer with my friend and unfortunately, it's like almost guaranteed that each of us will be disconnected one by one in the middle of battle. Also when I'm in the game (whether in quests or menu), I often auto-disconnect from the server and I needed to re-connect into the server again, so for now the game is best played offline.\nAnother issue is the system requirements. This game is very demanding that even some high-end PC's won't run well here. I'm running at GTX 970M and I needed to set graphical elements from mid to low setting in 1080p. The explainatory doesn't end there, my GPU is overclocked and it still runs at 50-65 fps range. It's not smooth 60 fps but it's definitely smooth enough and playable.

I'd give it 9/10 at the current state but if capcom manages to fix the multiplayers perfectly, this is an easy 10/10.

It's accessable. \n\nMH fans might feel jarred or put off by some of the more convienient and less restrictive flow of MHW. It feels less structured and rigid than previous titles, even those with a bit of story. I was certainly thinking, 'wow, that's easier. That makes it less MH' But then there were so many systems in place that at points I felt a bit overwhelmed by new ways of doing things. All done I assume to make it more accessable to people unfamiliar with the franchise.\n\nAnd I think this is where newer people might come unstuck. There's a lot to take in because of this and the first few hours was tutorial based things. I am not even sure I am out of it yet. It still has the MH feel of dropping you in and letting you go despite this, which is great but also bad because newer players might not really get to the meat of the game before dismissing it. It sort of feels midground.\n\nI have had a couple crashes and one issue with online but that has been it. The online is a little confusingly done but so much better than the way it used to be, once you get your head round it, it's not so bad. Room for improvement though.\n\nIt also runs... Not as well as you would hope. I have a mid tier system and it runs well enough on mid settings for it still to be a pretty game. But its not a smooth 60 experience. But coming from those 3DS days, or even PSP, I don't care.\n\nBut the game play... Oh it's there alright.\n\nThere is so much more to do other than slash and smash your way through a roster of monsters and this game is oozing personality in lots of subtle ways. It's great. There is a lot of content in this game, if you are willing to put the time in and learn what it's about. \n\nThe combat is great on KBM, I was planning on using a controller but I actually prefer KBM. MH games have a really great combat system, with lots of subtle things and it isn't for everyone admittedly but if you are a MH fan, this title stays true but innovates enough to be fresh.\n\nThe quest system wasn't what I was used to either, it feels much more RPG or MMO styled, picking up quests that aren't story based from NPCs related to what they do in regards to rewards. But it's actually a really nice change and much more immersive than 'pick from this list'.\n\nMy recommendation is with caution, if you love MH you can't miss this one. If you've played MH before and thought, meh, this one might be the one to get you hooked. \n\nIf you don't know if you like MH, you like hack n slash or you are expecting a Dark Souls experience tm, do lots of research before buying because it isn't for everyone and with some of the less appealing points, such as optimisation, it might not be for you. \n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44057545", "timestamp_created": 1533953917, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1576280207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_forever": 10834, "steamid": "76561198044004536", "num_reviews": 19}, "timestamp_updated": 1533953917, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544043838977813721", "review": "Monster hunter randomly hard crashed on me while i was doing a quest with my friends.

Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game that you should go out and play right now if you're fan of:\n\n- The Monster Hunter Series (obviously).\n- Constant and pure boss fights.\n- Teamwork.\n- Rewarding gameplay.\n- A good amount of content.\n\nThere's absolutely no contest. In my opinion, as a Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate player, this is the best game in the series to date. Some aspects can be fixed and/or improved but the overall package is pure Monster Hunter love all around.\nI would've liked to see some monsters returning to the franchise but the new monsters do scratch that itch you're looking for. However, not everything is flowers and roses, like I said. The game has a few negative aspects that I do not find pleasing at all:\n\n- Your HR(progress) is locked behind a main story.\n- Unskippable cutscenes, UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES WHY.\n- Can't join a hunt if the player is doing a main story hunt and they haven't watched all cutscenes (WHY DID THEY DO THIS).\n- No G-rank (as of now, but iceborn will add Master Rank).\n- Bad gathering hub this time around. It's pointless to use it mostly.\n- Not good optimization for PC although it's been slightly improved (I run the game perfectly with a FX 8320 and a RX 480).\n- NO ZAMTRIOS.\n\nEverything else are pros from my point of view. Just be aware, if you plan to buy it to play with your friends, every single one of you will have to join a main story hunt separately, then leave and join to a single one after the cutscenes play. I still have no idea why they thought this was a good idea. The cutscenes played just fine in MH4U.\n\nThose are the caveats I found and this comes from a Monster Hunter fan.

Having an i5 processor and a decent graphics card I was confused, and decided to check the settings. It told me that (even at the lowest possible Graphics settings) it was overtaking my graphics card and RAM space, but when I tabbed out of the game, my computer was totally fine. I decided to experiment, and tabbed out again, my computer was still fine.\nThis game is absolutely beautiful, the movements are realistic, and the environments are nothing short of awe-inspiring.\nBut the voice acting is terrible. Given that it was originally a Japanese game I expect the lip sync to be bad, but the voice acting is terrible. Just turn voice off. On top of this, a lot of people complain that the in-town music is annoying and I agree. To fix that problem, find a Spotify playlist or something, mute your music when you get into town, and press play on that playlist. Boom, instant fix.\nGetting into the game is like a slap in the face. It hits you with more information and you can get comfused fast. Here are my tips for newcomers like myself:\nWatch these two videos:\n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JycMIKonIZ4 (A source that explains weapon types)\n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQmqyIEXQH4 (A decent beginner's guide to tell you what you should do first)\nSome pointers:\n - To make your Palico's equipment, you need things called research points. You can't start getting research points until you finish the second story quest where you kill the Great Jagras,\n - Scout Flies are super helpful! Follow them, look at footprints to upgrade them, and you won't get lost, have to spend an agonizing amount of time looking at footprints, or miss out on resources you wish you had grabbed on that last big monster hunt.\n - Start with the defender armor, and abandon it as soon as you've finished the first couple missions. This way, you don't have to use crappy leather or chainmail as a last resort and make something you like, but be safe in the process.\n - Play with a controller if at all possible. This game was originally made for console-based controllers. It's just the smart thing.\n - Experiment with different fighting styles. Fainting is a-okay, and so is failing the mission, so long as you can find a good comfort zone for yourself without breaking that controller I told you to play with by smashing it into your nice 4K monitor you waited so long to buy.\n - Grab literally everything. Thing on the wall? Grab it. Weird bug? Grab it. Monster intestines? Grab it. They may not seem important now, but the further you get into the game the more you're going to need that weird shit you grabbed along the way.\n\nI hope this helped!\n8/10 so far,\nZeph :)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "60268461", "timestamp_created": 1576961862, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579996145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 356, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 5311, "steamid": "76561198282191809", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1576961862, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "yes good", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "55344610", "timestamp_created": 1569811575, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580107957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6947, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 65431, "steamid": "76561198284214304", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1569811575, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "Of course its fun,\nespecially with friends.\n(Also u can Naruto run with Dash Potion and Dual Blades which is like every weebs' dream)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "55127470", "timestamp_created": 1568565083, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580133973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3614, "num_games_owned": 346, "playtime_forever": 11166, "steamid": "76561198853723766", "num_reviews": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1568565083, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "If you ever wanted to try to get into the Monster Hunter series, then you found the best entry point right here.

Annoying because it's extremely fun to play, BUT due to silly design choices and port related bugs it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nLet's just get the port issues out of the way. Performance is not at acceptable levels, settings menu is incomplete, kb/m controls are horrible for UI management but ironically just fine for combat, and there's a lot of disconnection issues. There's other issues as well but you might or might not encounter them so too rare to actually be mentioned.\n\nIf you only cared about those few things, there you have a quick summary. But if you want a more detailed look into the actual game, grab a metaphorical drink and read the rest! Or just go look at the scores while I grab a literal drink wondering why I even wrote this. Anywho...\n\nThe overall game consists of doing basically 1 thing, hunting monsters. There's some story but not even the game cares about it. But at the same time the story is simplistically stupid enough that it fits with the actual gameplay. You are a hunter who is.. well.. a hunter. It just happens that dinosaurs are still around, even bigger and literally more magical, so hunting is a serious business organized almost like an army. And that's about as far as it goes, but that's not a bad thing at all as the game attempts to build all of its details around that.\n\nFrom big things like the overall story, to small things like player animations, it all fits right in. For a quick example, during the opening cutscene, your character weirdly focus a bit too much on a food platter without much context. That seems completely out of place at first, but as you get to play even further and see the way your character is animated and the way they react, that starting little detail made more sense. It was a very simple way of driving in the point that you are a fully-fledged hunter, not some kind of noble hero. You are not there to find yourself or save the world or whatever, just there to do your job.\n\nIt's not just your character that acts like but the NPCs as well to a certain extent. Everyone seems to be excited to be in this place full of mystery and research opportunities. Buuuut that's a hugely missed opportunity. For all the detail that went to drive in the point, your character is at the end of the day just a silent protagonist who does what they are told, at most nodding, not even ever declining anything. The NPCs start acting all friendly towards you as the story moves on, but it never feels like you want to care about what they say, of course they would start acting friendly towards the supposedly top hunter in their little organization. A few dialogue options and small side missions would have made a whole lot difference.\n\nBut why would a game like that need such a thing, right? Well the game literally teases you about it. It keeps talking about your supposed bond between you and your \"partner\" and how you 2 are doing a great job and whatnot! ... Well I am mentioning her existance right now because that matters so little she might as well not be your partner but could have been a different character every time she was on screen and the story would have been the same.\n\nOu that's a lot of words about the part of a game barely anyone cares about. \n\nAnyway, combat. It's fun, the end. Barely any complaints about the combat itself, it's the best thing about this game. Your weapons feel nice and heavy, animation quality is amazing for almost everything you or the monsters do, and there's just enough fluff like the screen shaking etc to make certain aspects feel even more impactful. You can also turn that off if it annoys you so win-win. If I were to complain about anything combat related is that the special tools you get are just boring as hell. But luckily they never become the focus, just a side thing to use if you need a bit of help.\n\nBut while the part of the combat you manually do is almost flawless, the armor building is ... problematic. Not the literal crafting but picking an armorset for your needs. The meshes and textures themselves look great, with little sound details like clinging metal depending on the set you are wearing. But you can't really have the set you want because of some arbitrary passive buff system. \n\nCertain gear gives certain buffs, things like higher resistance to certain things, higher defense, immunity to stuff, that kind of thing. But they are not given to gear in a logical fashion, but springled in an almost random way. For example, a belt making you withstand monster roars better than a headpiece. That makes it partically impossible to pick the look you want AND the buffs you want. On top of that silliness going on, \"boss\" specific armor more often than not gives you benefits fighting against... that boss and that boss only. So in order to have an easier time fighting a boss you need to first keep fighting that boss to get the gear that boss gives material for, but after you got all the gear you have no reason to fight that boss anymore. It's not impossible to make kind of a build you want without having to sacrifice too much on the looks, or you can just ignore those passive benefits all together and pick the set you want, but that would be purposely putting yourself at a disadvantage.\n\nAND FINALLY, co-op and general online play. The game was clearly made to be played co-op, but it does not allow you to go through the story in co-op, meaning that you will NOT be able to play with your friends or even other random people through matchmaking until you reach the end-game where you'd have mostly everything unlocked. It also cuts the money you get after each mission if it was done with other people, straight up punishing you for playing with them. And then there's the lobby system. IGNORING disconnections, 16 people per session is not enough to do anything, and the matchamaking prioritizes ping over your progression, so you can end up in a session with everyone being too low to join in hunts that you might want...\n\nThere's hackers too, so going in a mission with randoms is a risk as they might just decide to ruin your fun.\n\nSooooooo because the interactions with NPCs are basically \"skip dialogue and go the menu\", grinding for gear is frustrating due to the impossible min-maxing of looks and utility and because of all the port related issues that do not allow you to have as much fun as the game intended you to, like playing co-op when you get bored, the game is suffering right now. While the bugs might be fixed, design choices will not, meaning that the game will never be as much fun as it should have been. Still, I did put 100 hours into it and I'll put more, because what it does right is done so right that I want more of it, it just doesn't give me a good reason to keep doing it. \n\nI'd have voted \"meh\" but since (that doesn't exist) my overall frustration with the game was because I enjoyed it yet the issues wouldn't go away, I'd have to recommend it.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44219714", "timestamp_created": 1534557471, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580061699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7654, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_forever": 50911, "steamid": "76561198021006779", "num_reviews": 88}, "timestamp_updated": 1534562499, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "I think you hunt monsters in this game or something", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44197441", "timestamp_created": 1534461791, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580120819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3342, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 44436, "steamid": "76561198118440165", "num_reviews": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1546024726, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "Finally, Monster Hunter on PC!\n\n-The Good\n\nAn excellent (and much awaited) update to the Monster Hunter formula that keeps all the good bits and cuts down on a lot of the busy-work of previous games, making it much more accessible to newcomers to the franchise, and keeping it enjoyable for the veterans.\n\nIf you've never played Monster Hunter, this is the one to start with.\n\nCapcom have already released a load of free new content on the console versions, which is scheduled to make its way to the PC in the near future.\n\n-The (potentially) Bad.\n\nThe PC version really is a great port but does require a powerful all-round machine to play on high settings, not just a good GPU.

WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! The only issues I have had are the slight server instabilities which is nowhere near as bad as it was for the console release, at least this is playable with some communication disconnects. Yes the default key bindings for the KB&M can be a little wonky but there are enough control options and key binding menus (with seperate melee and ranged binding options) that anyone who takes the time to make them work for you will not have an issue. The game was designed and built for a controller but I started playing with the KB&M and after some tweaks will not go back now. Even without direct mouse input the game flows a lot better and easier with the speed and precision a mouse brings along with the customization that a KB allows. I am running a EVGA 1070 with an Intel I7 6400K and have only 1 time had a stutter in my FPS with a drop from 60fps to 48fps.

Mainstream Monster Hunter on PC. No longer do I need to learn Korean to play Frontier.\n2. More immersive. Wildlife seems to be more realistic (Most monsters on the lower end of the foodchain try to hide or escape upon seeing a bigger bad)\n3. Turf wars. Monsters have special animations when fighting each other for territory.\n4. Movement is more fluid.\n5. Hitbox is pretty accurate. If a monster tail passed above your head and missed you by an inch, it won't hit you. No more bullsh*t hipchecks.\n\nTHE SO-SO\n1. Horrible camera controls for mouse users have been FIXED\n2. Difficulty in joining online sessions has been FIXED\n3. Constant disconnects from online sessions have been FIXED \n4. Food looks good.\n\nTHE BAD:\n1. Very ugly, Fortnite-level textures on some objects despite being on the highest setting. NOT YET FIXED.\n2. People getting carted (killed) in the first 5 minutes of every hunt.\n3. Lack of monster variety. Why does the Old World have more monsters despite being the cradle of humans and hunters.\n4. Map count is very limited compared to previous titles. Even the first Monster Hunter on the PS2 has more maps iirc.\n5. The game is still a big CPU hog.\n6. No way to remove the useless items like nets fishing rod, palico commands, etc. on your item hotbar.\n\n\nThe game was released in a rough state, but it's pretty good now if you can mostly get over the ugleh textures and occasional frame drops.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44056388", "timestamp_created": 1533948729, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575983760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 17833, "steamid": "76561198043944308", "num_reviews": 48}, "timestamp_updated": 1538905151, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "No problems, great follow up to MH I and MHFU :D\nController works and fps is fine on my 3570k and 1060 6gb", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44039367", "timestamp_created": 1533893608, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1572561850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 9585, "steamid": "76561197975880317", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1533893608, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "review": "Hunt monsters. with friends. what else!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44032108", "timestamp_created": 1533863638, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578806798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 6448, "steamid": "76561198151734766", "num_reviews": 79}, "timestamp_updated": 1537642050, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541972517967224121", "review": "Game of the Year ;D", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44326471", "timestamp_created": 1535009291, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575826438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_forever": 27597, "steamid": "76561198096170699", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1535009291, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541960239410400391", "review": "Okay, now this is epic.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "52377813", "timestamp_created": 1561889104, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580078855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7424, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 73225, "steamid": "76561198050456102", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1561889104, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541900932788848877", "review": "potato server", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "44166042", "timestamp_created": 1534340519, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1543808864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 1337, "playtime_forever": 13277, "steamid": "76561198089721639", "num_reviews": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1534340519, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541861891746520996", "review": "Error 50382-MW1", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44206472", "timestamp_created": 1534507210, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1554694161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 1187, "steamid": "76561198030205952", "num_reviews": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1534507210, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 3, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541844487190246582", "review": "First and foremost, this is going to be my review as a longtime veteran, having played since 3 Ultimate and with ~1000 hours combined in every game since. As such, a large portion of this review is going to be a comparison with classic monster hunter. This is also my second time going through the game, having reached and played a large portion of the endgame on PS4. At its core, Monster Hunter: World is a huge quality of life update to classic Monster Hunter. However, the game does suffer from some major flaws - especially in the multiplayer department. \n\nNow, let\u2019s start with what the game absolutely does right. The game is gorgeous - people have been dreaming of an HD Monhun for years and now that it\u2019s finally here it really is breathtaking. Seamless, wide-open areas make the flow of the hunt more natural and the Monster AI itself has taken a huge step forward. Gathering has now become increasingly streamlined, cutting a large portion of busy work out of the game. Animations for both hunter and monster have been revamped and look smoother than they\u2019ve ever been before. World is almost definitely the best single player experience that the Monster Hunter series has to offer. \n\nHowever, take one look at the co-op multiplayer and suddenly the game starts to break at the seams. First, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room. The PC release has had consistent server issues ever since launch, making it near impossible to play with friends. Even without friends, often times you\u2019ll drop into an SOS and disconnect before the end of the hunt. However, these issues can be patched eventually and I personally, will not be counting this as a huge downside to the game. \n\nWhat SHOULD and WILL be counted against the game is the failed structure that the game implements. Going from Monster Hunter Generations to World, Capcom decided to cut the old Monster Hunter formula and combine both the single player and multiplayer campaigns into one entity. It\u2019s from this one decision that almost all major issues with the game arise. You\u2019ve likely all heard the biggest complaint about playing through the story co-op by now - the cutscene requirement. Having to watch all cutscenes, leave, then join a friend who also has to have watched the cutscenes is completely obtuse and ruins any sort of pacing the game has going for it. It\u2019s jarring, frustrating, and completely removes you from the experience. What\u2019s even worse is that this was a non-issue in previous titles. The only reason it\u2019s a problem now is that, like previously mentioned, the story and multiplayer are now combined. Capcom is trying to preserve the experience of going through a campaign seemingly by yourself but by not setting them into 2 different sets of quests they\u2019re simply contradicting themselves and making it a hassle for almost all players.\n\nAnother major problem that arises from combining single and multiplayer is often glossed over by other players and critics. Personally, I feel that this is because a large portion of the playerbase is inexperienced and thus will not be able to relate, but if you\u2019ve put in a good chunk of time into any monster hunter game before suddenly there\u2019s not much reason to play multiplayer anymore. Any hunt that you do multiplayer, especially during the campaign, could be done solo faster and more easily. In previous games, multiplayer difficulty was always higher than solo. This encouraged you to find other players to play with - now, often adding more players can prove detrimental. This, combined with the sheer difficulty of finding and joining any multiplayer hunts just removes any sort of motivation to play with other people. These issues were remedied slightly in some of the endgame quests on PS4 (Kulve Taroth), but PC has yet to see even a glimpse of those and likely will not for months. \n\nThis leads into, in my opinion, the game\u2019s biggest flaw. The game just feels lonely! People praise the SOS mechanic, but the culture behind it honestly bothers me. Players tend to simply disband after any given hunt. Gone is the simple camaraderie of playing with the same people for an entire session, exchanging guild cards and adding each other. This is made even worse by the fact that you can\u2019t see other players from your session in Astera. It may have been slightly archaic, but having everybody in the same instance for multiplayer in the past games was really quite nice. You can say that you can simply return to the gathering hub after a quest, but in all my playtime I really have yet to see this happen even once with randoms. Having 16 players to a lobby is another huge issue - any one of these players could jump in to your hunt at any time and you\u2019d have no idea who they were. In past games, it was 4 to a lobby, so you almost certainly knew that the people who were in your room were the people who you would be hunting with. There\u2019s just this huge disconnect with the rest of the community, and it really is a shame. It makes it feel like you\u2019re playing a single player game with cameos from other players rather than the excellent co-op of the previous games. \n\nNow, in light of all of this negativity it would seem as if I absolutely loathe the game. But in truth, I don\u2019t. The core single player monster hunter experience is still intact. The game as a whole is a lot easier than previous entries which, as a veteran, displeases me, but it makes the game a great entry point for the series. I\u2019d recommend the game to almost all new players of the series. It\u2019s just that the more and more I play World, the more and more I miss classic Monster Hunter. The game has its moments - not having to cycle urgents 4 times for an entire party is an understated blessing, but at the same time this is just another small quality of life change. Monster Hunter: World manages to fix many of the quality of life problems that previous Monster Hunter games had. However, it fails to deliver on many of the core aspects of co-op Monster Hunter that were so central to the series as a whole. I\u2019ll honestly keep playing it for a love of the series, but I have to say, it\u2019s really just disappointing. \n", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "44104925", "timestamp_created": 1534108414, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580118437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2450, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 14651, "steamid": "76561198098815524", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1534108414, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541832864284515381", "review": "I feel like Capcom has done a OK job at adressing the problems of MHW, there is still some disconnect, but not even close to the problems that i had when first playing the game on release.

Stop writing negative reviews regarding a problem that the Capcom team is working on fixing. All online games have connectivity issues at one point or another and you are supposed to be writing a review on the game itself. 2) All of you \"bad port\" people? You have no idea what you're talking about. Some people are having no problems with framerate or playability with this game and their specs and some people are having some problems. It all is dependent on your HARDWARE. If you bought crappy off-brand hardware of course you're gonna have problems.\n\nAnd now to the review: Back when the Nintendo Wii was still putting out games, my two brothers and I pooled together our savings and bought Monster Hunter 3 Tri. Thus began a love for this series with all three of us. Capcom has been a little sketchy with universal releases and once Monster Hunter: WORLD was announced, we were all stoked. We bought the game once it released on the PC (even though I was worried I wasn't going to be able to run it on my lower-end computer) and have been going through the game together.\n\nMy specs: Processor - AMD FX-6300 RAM - 8 GB of RAM Video - GTX 750 ti 2GB \n\nStory - This game has a way more in-depth story than any of the previous games and it is very enjoyable to play and read the dialogue.\n\nGraphics - I can run on mid settings with a solid 30fps (good enough for me). The look of this game is beautiful even on these settings. My youngest brother can have uncapped framerates on his 1060.\n\nConnectivity - I have only had one issue with connectivity when playing with my brothers. We reloaded the game and it was fixed. Also, for those who are having this issue, Capcom is fixing it so PLEASE stop giving the game a negative review due to ONE issue with the game.\n\nPlayability - Overall, a great port (if it is one). But, I kind of doubt it is a port because it took them 7 months to bring it to the PC?\n\nOverall, this is a great game and I am looking forward to future DLC.

First timer to the Monster Hunter Series. Long-time MMORPG player.\n\n9/10 | The Graphics are great! Compared to previous entries, which i've always followed, it looks awesome. \n10/10 | The Combat. If you've seen the trailer, you know its good. You FEEL the hits and FEEL good! Especially when you pull off a combo or the perfect positioning attack. Having  14 weapons to choose from is a HUGE added value too and all vary in gameplay. So try them all out. \n4/10 | The Story... is a story. Not that great, but you do feel a sort of relationship with the characters. Won't really be invested in the npcs as much as you get invested with the monsters that you slay/capture.\n9/10 | Great Replayability. Create your own build. Learn all the weapons. Challenge stronger monsters. Find a multitude of ways to slay/capture a monster. \n\nHope to see more kinds/types of monsters added to the game.\nLooking forward to the DLCs and would definitely pay for new significant content! \n\nOn a personal note regarding other reviews:\nWhile there may be problems with the multiplayer at launch, this is common with any game launch on any platform. I think people have their expectations set way too high. Monster hunter is NOT an MMORPG. It is more of a single player game, rather than a multiplayer. Though the multiplayer is an awesome addition to the game, being a key feature with the previous entries on handheld consoles. \n\nPlaying with friends is a BIG PLUS, but i think the game should not be put at the same standard as MMORPGs or Online Shooters. Monster hunter can be played solo throughout the whole game, whilst an MMORPG cannot be played offline. Heck, even MMORPGS have bad/rough launches due to connection issues. It is a common occurance. \n\nSo please be reasonable with your reviews, especially if you have invested a TON of time into the game. As the future of the game; like new content, could be impacted by your review.\n\n- UPDATE - \nAcquired tons of Layered Armours from events.\nNew Expansion announced and I am not disapointed.

The fact that it has mixed reviews can be misleading. The game itself is gorgeous, with very modern physics for a game in this day of age. The ambiance is amazing. The combat system is complex, with a variety of weapons to choose from, depending on your playstyle. It's better to team up with friends in hunting the bigger monsters, though, taking on a furry t-rex solo was both challening and fun.  \n\nWith the hours I put into this game, I am very addicted and satisfied with the choice I made with my purchase. My only wish is being able to interact with the Palico companion more, since you do get little pets to place into your room, and be able to interact with them. A little sad that I don't get to cuddle the kitty friendo. \n\nCharacter customization is what I love in games. A lot of options to choose from, including facial features, expressions, the use of a color wheel and makeup. \nDon't  forget to pick up your free dlc for more hair choices and a free voucher to edit your character if you don't like how they look in the beginning. \n\nOverall, the crafting system is very unique, as in, being able to have pages open on crafting the necessary components to craft what you actually need. What you need solely depends on how much you research and harvest on your expeditions.\nYou can fend off your foes with parts you've obtained from their species and have forged into your gear. Keep an eye on effects, skills and stats your gear offers. Mixing and matching can benefit you in many ways. \n\nResearching your hunts is a huge benefactor in the game. The more you track/research them, the more you understand what  they are strong and weak against, as well as their locations, territory, diet and rivals. Watching your prey fight another monster is quite a sight and you can use this to your advantage.\n\nThe hunts themselves are really fun, especially having to track and chase down your prey. Again, depending on your weapon of choice, the hunt may result in a quicker downfall of the monster. I was able to take down a Pukei-Pukei without having it run off with the Jagras form of the Commission Axe. Very satisfying, considering I was taking a chance with the bow at first. \n\nEating is key in this game, depending on what you get at the canteen effects various stats for yourself and your Palico. I also, at least, recommend watching the cutscene of the Palicos preparing your meal at least once. On your hunts/expeditions, you can also prepare your own quick meal  with raw meat. What you do with the meat is up to you; whether tainting it for your next kill, or grilling it to the beat of the music for an increase of stamina and recovery. \n\nUpgrading and forging armor and weapons is a little mundane, and depends on what is it you're after. Choose a weapon that you can understand the combos with, and understand how affinity works.  You upgrade your weapon, if you want a higher damage, but downgrade if you want to expand the branches, and increase elemental effects or obtain even more damage. Understand that the furthur you progress in the game, the more parts you can unlock to upgrade your weapons. \n\nHonestly, if you are a PC gamer, understand that this game is better with a controller.

Haven't had a connection drop since the patch and loading times are nice and quick.  With that out of the way, I can best describe MHW as 'repetition done fun.'  You start the game with a \"Story Mode,\" which is essentially a glorified tutorial, getting new players situated with the world, your weapons, and - of course - your rogue's gallery of monsters that you will become well-aquainted with as you beat the ever living daylights out of on your way to creating loadouts and sets for every occasion.  You begin in Low Rank, going through story quests that pit you against most of the monsters.  Eventually you graduate to High Rank, which unlocks tougher versions of the same monsters in low rank, as well as some new ones that are only available in HR.  From there you move up to the six Elder Dragons that are apart of the base game (I'm not counting Zorah...as you don't really fight him per say.)  More to come in future updates as the PC version of the game catches up to the console version.\n\nSpeaking of updates, everything that contains ACTUAL content is FREE.  That's right folks, no EA shenanigans here.  New monsters, new weapons/armor sets, holiday events and festivals, and siege events are free and will be added to the game as an automatic update.  Only cosmetic items such as stickers, gestures, and a couple of armor skins actually require monetary purchase.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game is repetitive, but if one ever finds the game becoming dull as a result, just change weapons.  MHW has 14 different weapon types in it, each with its own style of play.  Want that satisfying feeling of KO'ing a charging monster ten times your size?  Roll the Hammer and play Whack-a-Mole with its face.  Want to look like and/or pretend to be a cool guy?  The Longsword and Dual Blades have some of the flashiest moves in the game.  Want to keep your distance because you're definitely not a coward or anything like that?  The Heavy Bowgun is basically an M60, have fun!\n\nAs for system requirements, my computer's getting a little on in years so I run the game on med-low settings to be safe, but that being said it runs smoothly and quickly even so.\n\nTL;DR\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 2GB x2\nCPU: Intel I7-6700k 4.0ghz 8MB Smart Cache LGA1151\nMB: GA-Z170X Gaming 3 LGA 1151 w/Crossfire\nRAM: 16GB\n\nRepetitive, but fun.  If you find a weapon getting boring, just swap.  Every style is different enough that it mitigates fighting the same monsters over and over.  Word of warning about Modding: Capcom is currently sitting on the fence.  If you want to play it on the safe-ish side, avoid anything that circumvents actual gameplay (basically any mod that changes the stores or introduces a 'one-hit-kill' weapon, etc).  If they do decide to crack down, those will be the first they target.\n\n8/10\nWould save Clifford from an Angry Pickle again.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45153254", "timestamp_created": 1538900583, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1567095663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 9378, "steamid": "76561198005655210", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1538900583, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284441947937012", "review": "Reviews make it look bad but a lot of the problems they point out have been fixed in my own experience i didnt have any real problems with this game give it a try", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44408913", "timestamp_created": 1535382314, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1570814284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_forever": 3573, "steamid": "76561198120746789", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1535382314, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541217923164367676", "review": "Game itself: 10/10\n\nThe inability to matchmake whatsoever/infrequently, getting kicked from session mid hunt and bsically being forced to play this single player when it revolves around playing with friends: 0/10.\n\nIf you're thinking of purchasing wait until Capcom puts it's money where it's mouth is and fixes it's servers.\n\n\"We're taking out time to make sure it's the best port it can be.\" \n\nGJ....", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44253557", "timestamp_created": 1534688051, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1538511953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 5185, "steamid": "76561198051040054", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1534688051, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541215777397155762", "review": "Good all around, graphics, story, gameplay etc. Better review when ive speedrun to end game for expansion. \n9/10 so far.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "61253512", "timestamp_created": 1578103796, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578787555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 1279, "playtime_forever": 1256, "steamid": "76561197984204955", "num_reviews": 44}, "timestamp_updated": 1578103796, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541200399398803711", "review": "yeah", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "50461947", "timestamp_created": 1556923374, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575990391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 12550, "steamid": "76561198186723778", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1556923374, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541141033172607422", "review": "been a MH franchise fans since the first series.

The sheer amount of enjoyment this game provides is spectacular with a unique combat system and game mechanics unique to the Monster Hunter genre. Easily a strong contender for a top game of all time, but they HAVE to FIX the netcode. If you're someone looking for a game with an in-depth monster hunting mechanic and deep gameplay mechanics, this is certainly the game for you. Just play it like you did the other Monster Hunter's and keep it offline till they get their ducks in a row unless you have friends on a LAN (and even then there will be disconnects).\n\nI am constantly getting disconnected and having to fend off a game that balances when people join, but does not revert back once they disconnect so you're left fighting a monster for 3x the time in a fight you already put 10 minutes into. Any time you forget about disconnecting issues and the team you random dropped in with is coordinating and dominating the monster. All of a sudden you will be grabbed and violently shook back to reality as the monster and the host stand still for 50 seconds and you are left in an empty game with a 4 person monster to kill. Fix the netcode. Having to play single player to avoid this is asinine, and hosting your own game ends up with people just dropping off and leaving you with an uneven spread of difficulty and your friends unable to rejoin because when someone drops out, their slot is unable to be refilled. \n\nNo amount of setting steam to udp/tcp or setting transmission packet speed, leaving your program in borderless window & not alt tabbing will resolve your disconnect issues.

[/h1]\nEdit: CPU optimization would be great, what did ya'll do for half a year for the port?\nIf you're wanting more realistically accessible co-op, go download Dauntless. I honestly laugh at the \"its not monster hunter\" fanboy comparison squads. It undisputably gets grouping up correct and 10x better than this AAA title where there's no excuse, as simple a concept as that should be by now.\n They've added a bunch of overly complicated and obsctructive shit in MHW that nobody gives a fuck about, we just want a 4 player lobby to invite people to. And some scaling for 2,3 and 4 players, not just 1 or 4, wouldn't go amiss. Fucking lazy Capcom.\n\nEver known another game where you can't join someone's quest until they've seen a short cutscene? Me neither.\n\nObjectively a great game on the surface, and playing lone wolf, but the amount of obstacles and bureaucracy if your intent is to progress through things mostly with friends, is baffling for a current gen online game.\n The systems in place punish you for wanting to do this, on a game tagged \"co-op\", and which shoves vague \"online sessions\" and such in your face from early on into the game. It's more akin to Dark Souls where you'll just drop in and drop out as you see fit, call for help if you care to.\n\n Except getting extra players can grossly backfire on you here because, if someone is downed they take one of your 3 \"Continues\" the same as if you died yourself. Simply put, if any of you die a collective total of 3 times, it's quest failed. They're shared. If you're solo, same thing. 2 players is also the same enemy scaling as 4 players. This is a great system to cultivate hatred for noobs. Hate to say, again Dauntless has a far better system in place for deaths and co-op play.\n\nUnrelated fact : Borderlands 1 is 9 years old.\n\nCouple this up with, the moment you are more than 1 player, the monsters hit harder and have way more health, and don't seem to respond to your attacks as often as they would solo (such as a good smack in the head causing a stagger instead of the monster taking a chunk out of you). So in short, [b] deaths are far more likely with more players unless everyone is either a giant puss or ninja tier evasion. [/b] And the monster turns into Jaws from james bond, in relation to how many fucks it gives from being hit.\n\nSo my experiences, as somebody who just beat Anjanath (the T-rex) a couple times, is that due to this poor balancing, it was easier to just \"git gud\" solo after a couple of failures, and get my gear in relative order, than open my game up online to get a squad. This is just a crying shame when I was under the impression teaming up and having folks bring different weapons etc was part of the appeal.\n\nSo whilst I will continue to play at my own loner boy pace, I have to give a thumbs down in protest to the awful anti-consumer \"partying up\" system. There's just none of the stock excuses to hand, it's not early access, it's not a low budget indie title, it's not a cheap game, it's in fact 25% more than the average release price.

However, I actually like it as it serves as a good entry point to the franchise and is quite accessible to many players. Adding fuel to the fire, the story is also really stupid,boring pointless and extremely forgettable with unskippable cutscenes it is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nFurther frustration, however, comes from the game itself with the server disconnecting every 10 minutes, confusing and non-sensical co-op / multiplayer with a questionable PC optimization.\n\nThe game is designed to be played in co-op as upon selecting your save file, you are immediately given the options to join multiplayer, create a session or join a friend's session. Joining the session does not put you in a shared hub meaning you cannot see other players in the same session thus have any interactions, unlike previous MH games. To participate in a quest, one has to post a mission and others has to run to the nearest quest board to accept it rather than just having it appear on the screen as you are already in the same session. Even when all 4 players joined the quest but did not select ready, the quest starter will depart on the job by themselves and others has to then depart individually to the same session.\n\nParticipation on main story missions requires everyone to first start the mission solo and play up to the point of encountering the boss and trigger the cutscenes associated with it. The players then need to quite the mission in order to join the story mission together. Otherwise, the game will tell you either that you have not progressed enough into the story to participate (When you clearly has) or the host has not finished the cutscenes and you cannot join. On top of this, the constant disconnects (or should I say random?) from the server will automatically kick you out of the multiplayer session and you either have to join again or play solo leaving an essential aspect of MH working smoothly only half of the time which ultimately ruins the fun of the game.\n\nDid I also mention that under full screen the game forces big picture mode which replaced the traditional steam overlay meaning you have to alt+tap out in order to talk with friends. Ridiculous.\n\nAs far as co-op goes, the game is not fit for purpose and currently half broken. However, IGN and many other outlets seem to say otherwise.\n\nBut hey, at least I can run the game smoothly...\n(Buy it with caution and Capcom fix your shits!!!)", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44091911", "timestamp_created": 1534072564, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578681593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 1998, "playtime_forever": 3641, "steamid": "76561198058002825", "num_reviews": 92}, "timestamp_updated": 1534675710, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540756821632385254", "review": "I can't recommend this game while it costs \u00a350 and the basics of multiplayer don't work... \n\nIll change it to positive and write a real review when they get their sh*t together.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44153935", "timestamp_created": 1534290952, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1555021774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 107, "playtime_forever": 7843, "steamid": "76561198079437201", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1534290952, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540669858455657959", "review": "FANTASTIC game.

I played Tri before this on the Wii and it feels like I am right back in the thick of it! Because this game was originally built for console, some controls may be confusing to use but there are easy workarounds if you find them. I would also say that the communication controls are a bit lackluster for a game that relies so much on coordination with other people. Many people have complained that some weapon types are confusing to use and can deter new players, which I agree. New players should definitely take some time to use the training area to test out different weapons and watch guides when needed. There are certainly easy and effective to use weapons as well as more difficult to learn but fun weapons that cater to a variety of playstyles. It also really helps to have friends to play with. It really enhances your experience when you find yourself working as a coordinated team with 3 other friends or strangers to take down big monsters.

There's a whole lot to do, whether it's farming, fighting new monsters, playing with friends, getting drunk at the canteen, fashion hunting, fishing,.. you name it. Plenty to do, you can very easily get over a thousand hours out of this game and still not get bored of it.\n\nHowever the online portion of the game...\nCapcom screwed co-op up. You HAVE to watch the monster cutscene BEFORE being able to send an SOS flare. And before your friends can join they also need to WATCH the cutscenes, which results in someone having to abandon the quest just to play with their friends... huge hassle, not enjoyable.\n\n\n\nHere are the pros and cons I found in a list.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n\n- Lots of replay value\n- Extremely fun with friends\n- Extremely fun alone\n- Main story lasts quite a while (took me ~ 43h to finish it, as a veteran of the series)\n- Great character customization\n- New monsters will be added via free DLC and game updates, adding to the replay value.\n- Game is a lot more casual compared to other MH games, making it easier to get into. Also a con for older players, read Cons for explanation.\n- AMAZING soundtrack.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Playing with friends is not enjoyable until you reach high rank. Unskippable cutscenes, and impossible to watch together. You must depart alone and then you can SOS flare for your friend(s) to join. This becomes much less of an issue in high rank where there's nearly no cutscenes anymore.\n- Forced motion blur, DoF, mouse acceleration.\n- Very CPU intensive. \n- As of the time of writing, online mode is really unstable - check the EDIT for a temporary fix.\n- Game is a lot more casual compared to other MH games, making it a bit too easy for people that have been following the series for a while. Gone are the moments where you can't sign up for a quest because you ran out of zenny, where you forget whetstones, potions, took the wrong weapon, etc.. Now all of those issues can quickly be solved, either within an expedition/quest itself or it's simply been removed (entry fee for quests). Also a pro, though overall it doesn't make the game less enjoyable to me, just more care-free.\n\n--\n\n\nNow, would I recommend it?\n\nDespite its flaws, yes, absolutely. It's a game worth the premium 60\u20ac price tag, and I recommend it vividly, the game is a huge sucess and there's a good reason behind it.

You can't get 144 fps ultra 4k... Awell...

Even when you think your armor set is already give the skills you need, the addition of Decoration Slot makes your armor can be even more powerful. They switch the mechanism between decoration and charm from previous series, now you farm for decoration and craft charms, but for me that's understandable since a single decoration jewel can hold 1 level of skill, that sometimes can improve your armor skill by a lot because some skill are only has 1 level and they're quite powerful.\n\nThis game graphically is beautiful, even in my kinda low-end PC, low resolution, low texture and it's below 60 fps most of the time, it is still beautiful (when you do not see it closely on purpose ofc :| ). And quite stable with only a little hiccup in framerate, but still fully playable, even when there's a lot of particle effect going on it still can hold up the framerate\n\nPlaying online is now better, less disconnected, and easier to connect to other session. Now it's depends on your connection, 10 Mbps speed, i think, is the minimum to play online without lagging. So you should set your Steam Download setting to pause download when playing this game. It's kinda sad tho they remove the squad system and changed that to Steam Group system, which doesn't seem to be the same system at all. I hope they gonna bring that to the PC version.\n\nOne of the complain i heard from someone who's already play Monster Hunter before is, MHW is kinda lacking of large monster varieties, with 17 new monsters (not including unreleased monster on PC) and 14 returning monsters (including deviljho), is lacking when compared to the new released MHGU on Switch that has 93 total large monster even though it's a spin off series. But in my point of view, since this World in MHW is \"New Found World\", so it's kinda natural to have fewer monster, since we're still discovering about this new World, but also because it's new World, i was hoping they will add new monster in future update, like the sub-species from the new monster. From the release of MHW on PS4 and XB1, we already been \"spoiled\" about the new monster like Kulve Taroth and Behemoth from FF Collaboration (Hoping we also got this event), and returning of Lunastra. And that just it, no other info about new monster. Let's hope they release sub-species from the new monsters. Tho, some people already make custom monster mods, like Nergigante and Xeno fusion, or Explosive Jagras, i don't want to mod my game right now until official says it safe.\n\nTL;DR\n- Great for beginners, returning player of the series can appreciate this new skill system or maybe loving it.\n- Graphically beautiful even in low settings\n- Server connection is already stable now, and now depends on your connection to be stable, with at least 10 Mbps\n- Still lacking in variety of monsters, and hoping they will add more monster, returning or sub-species of the new ones\n- Addition: This game is a grinding heavy, so if you're not liking grinding games, you should avoid it. Although you can always change the monster you hunt time to time and set goal of what you want to make so you don't get bored easily\n- Addition: Hunt with friends, it much more fun that way, even on losing the quest, you still have fun time laughing at your team rage carting, kek", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44710326", "timestamp_created": 1536834417, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580087168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2405, "num_games_owned": 579, "playtime_forever": 31533, "steamid": "76561198010323210", "num_reviews": 28}, "timestamp_updated": 1536834417, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537261903285980225", "review": "If you dont't pet your Poogie before every hunt, are you even a real Hunter?", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "62412232", "timestamp_created": 1579992903, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579829259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1823, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 6977, "steamid": "76561198878534011", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1579992903, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537261903285980225", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.

It offers good tutorials, and really guide player through the quest and various features this game has to offer.\nFor veterans who dived into this franchise for thousands of hours, this game will offer you new challenges in form of new monster, new combat mechanic, new maps to explore, new armorsets to obtain, and many more.\n\nBut then, this game surely need its time to grow.  The end-game feels like non-existant, or like some others say, 'artificial difficulty'. [spoiler]The tempered and arch-tempered monsters doesn't feel good when fought, they just have increased damage and health, no new movesets or mechanic. And God-level RNG needed to get just one attack jewel needed to complete your basic high rank build.[/spoiler] It is so much different than the end game of previous titles that I have played, where CAPCOM added more wyverns and elder dragons, and even new difficulty level which we know as G-Rank.\n\nCAPCOM sure has put lots of time in porting this game from console to PC, and have a bad review on launch, but they act rapidly and starting to solve problems in the PC port, ranging from performance, to network problems. In addition to that, the current Lunastra update makes this game gets closer to being 'the same level' as it is in the console.\n\nIn short, this game is worth playing, but I hope we'll see new content as time goes by.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46597329", "timestamp_created": 1542985224, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579970183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 19222, "steamid": "76561198032712741", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1542985297, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537036478519439697", "review": "the only reason i down voted this game is due to whats seem every one else is complaining about and thats the co-op play needs to be much more easier to join a friends game it doesnt show that friends have a session then it does, this needs sorting soon or it will ruin the game for alot of people and its a shame.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44216170", "timestamp_created": 1534540177, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1535588500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 5794, "steamid": "76561198016851333", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1534540177, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536887109279632568", "review": "IB came out well with little to no problem for me, only encounter a minor lag like once or twice.

Simply back up your save beforehand to avoid losing progress. It's under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata[YOUR STEAM ID HERE]\\582010\\remote\n\nNow then, onto the port. \n\nThe game has run beautifully from start to finish on my little old 960 with a mix of medium to high settings. A solid 60fps ensured that every hunt felt incredible, from flow to mechanics to just enjoying the stunning environments as I bashed Azure Rathalos' stupid noggin in.\n\nMake sure to check your specs on the store page. If you aren't up to snuff then it's not a great idea to buy the game.\n\nAs for the game itself, well.\n\nMonster Huter World is the most recent addition to the franchise, it boast much higher graphical fidelity, greater quality of life features and most importantly, no zone transitions between areas.\n\nI went in blind on day 1 and immediately got hooked, taking out low rank relatively quickly and having a blast while doing so. From Jagras to Magdaros, every fight felt unique and challenging in their own ways. The monsters themselves feel much more responsive than previous games and some are pretty challenging if you haven't done your homework on them.\n\nAs for gear, the team did a fantastic job of reimagining the movesets for weapons. Adding in new combos and mechanics that make them all feel organic to the combat as a whole. I started with the trusty Insect Glaive which boasts a new aerial dodge, new attack animations for the ground and air combos as well as a new elemental/status/healing bug swarm foe the Kinsect to summon. Once hit, the cloud of bugs will apply whatever damage, element or effect your Kinsect is alligned to and they can make for some great combo extenders and openers.\n\nAbout halfway into High Rank I switched back to my MH3U main, the Greatsword. Oh boy, the new greatsword... They added a shoulder tackle that you can use to cancel out of your charged swing or out of a roll as a quicker way to reach the new finisher that does some pretty big boy damage and feels incredible to land. The addition of aerial combat as introduced by 4 has been expanded upon too, when you jump off a ledge there's a brief window where you can hop in any direction when you begin the aerial swing which can be used to combo even the hardiest monsters into submission. Plus you can now charge your aerial swing which allows for greater damage and a higher chance of mounting the monster.\n\nThere are a number of new mobility mechanics that make the game flow so much smoother than older iterations, my favourite being the slide. When you sprint or roll on a slope your character will slide down at incredible speeds. You can even use new slide attacks out of it and some can even be charged or have a follow-up move.\n\nThere's also a grappling hook that makes climbing feel much faster as well as it's utility in the newest addition to your hunter arsenal, the Slinger. This little wrist mounted crossbow type weapon can be used with any weapon type and has a ton of ammo types and the ability to grapple onto special grapple points in order to swing around some areas for quicker movement and a nice evasive/offensive option in fights.\n\nThe slinger boasts a ton of ammo types, including things like throwing knives and various pods used in previous games. There are a number of other types that can be found in the environments including ones like: \n\n-Brightmoss, which glows and sticks to whatever it hits, useful for pointing out monster weak points to inexperienced members or just for lighting up dark areas.\n\n-Stone, becuse who doesn't love flinging rocks at monsters? Useful for drawing agro and knocking down certain flora which includes some other ammo types.\n\n-Scatternut, does a lot of stagger damage and can be useful for extending your friends' combos as they go to town.\n\n-Slinger Thorn, sticks to the target and can be hit to deal additional damage. Useful for monster parts that bounce some weapon types and for breaking parts in general.\n\n-Watermoss, deals a small amount of water damage and can be used to wash certain dirty monsters for easier damage. \n\nThere are many more types all with unique effects and utility, making the Slinger an incredibly useful tool for hunting and exploring. Some more fantastical than others, but they all have their uses.\n\nNow for quality of life.\n\nThe first thing I checked was item sets, these are useful for hunters that like to save time at the item box between hunts. Although for another point, camps also have item boxes now. You can enter your tent to change gear and access the item box mid hunt. To make them even more useful you can now eat at camp, meaning if you forget to get your pre-hunt grub on you don't have to worry about being at a disadvantage any more. Oh, and you can fast travel to your camps from anywhere on the map.\n\nMoving on, there's the item wheel. This handy little guy lets you quickly use specific items on the fly without cycling through your entire inventory. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this feature is a massive help to the Sword and Shield as it is the only weapon that lets you use items without sheathing it first. It also let's you use the slinger while it's drawn which is great for setting up combos.\n\nI also want to talk about how decorations and charms work now. Instead of the traditional points system, abilities now use levels. Say you have a Fire Res decoration, it'll just give you a level in the Fire Res skill when slotted instead of just 2/5 points needed for the first tier of the skill in previous games. Decorations also come in three sizes and as such, so do decoration slots themselves. Meaning the bigger the decoration, the more levels it will provide in the skill it gives.\n\nCharms are more or less the same deal, they give specific abilities just like decorations but now they can be upgraded depending on the type. These additions really streamline the skill system and make for a much easier time going for a build you want to use. \n\nArmour also functions in the same way, but now there are set bonuses on some sets. Unlike other games though, most don't require you to wear a full set, but rather just 2-5 pieces of the set. This allows for much more freedom without making it feel like a chore to go for specific setups.\n\nThe verdict, \n\nAll in all, I'm really enjoying my time with MHW. Connection issues aside it's a fantastic port of a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Couple that with Capcom releasing existing console events and DLC quests for free at a faster rate and you've got a pretty good deal in my book.\n\nI will say though that I do have a couple of minor peeves with the game. The first is that the faces look pretty bad up close and the second is the lack of unique weapon designs. Both very minor things, but they do detract a bit from my personal experience.\n\nI can't recommend the game enough to anyone looking for a fun hunting sim/ARPG hybrid. There's plenty to do in the game which makes it a great time sink too. Just make sure you can run it before purchase and all should be well.\n\nWe even just got a patch to address the connectivity issues that were present at launch within the month of release, that's what I'd call consumer friendly.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOnline can be pretty bad at times currently with disconnections from Steam, but the game itself is incredible and completely playable solo. It's well worth a buy in my book and I'm dying for more content already.\n\nIf you like to hunt, or play good ARPGs, get it.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44256218", "timestamp_created": 1534695539, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580092396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7069, "num_games_owned": 401, "playtime_forever": 35660, "steamid": "76561198122566602", "num_reviews": 48}, "timestamp_updated": 1535234747, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 3, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53586500883102417", "review": "2 days since the server patch update, no random drops during missions so far, changing review to positive, thanks capcom", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44169622", "timestamp_created": 1534350000, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580111768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4548, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_forever": 35993, "steamid": "76561198048980290", "num_reviews": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1535154201, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535832345485687256", "review": "The next generation of Monster Hunter is bright.\n\nFor months, I was worried this game would be a poorly ported mess with numerous bugs, crashes, and missing content updates the console versions had, and while the first 2-3 weeks have been rough as far as the multiplayer connection quality goes, I am seeing little improvements Capcom is making to correct their mistakes on a remarkable game that I have happily purchased on my Xbox One, Playstation 4, and now my PC.\n\nThe improvement in combat, monster AI, and movement is undeniably great, this no longer feels like the clunky monster hunter you used to play on your PSP and/or 3DS.

Wait for a sale; $40 is a good pricepoint.\n\nPROS:\n--The landscape is pretty and scenic and there is a great variety of textures all over, \n--Monsters are visually stunning and use their assigned 'tactics' well\n--The mood of the game is fun and adventurous and will keeping you playing based on nothing more than energy\n--Lots of things to click and upgrade and mats to collect; satisfies that collector/crafter itch\n--Substantial variety of weapons that allows for many different approaches and what I expect to be replayability.\n\nCONS:\n--A number of items are surprisingly low resolution for being such commonplace occurences in game.\n--Poor voice acting in a very over-the-top style.  It's fitting given the art and target audience but I found it offputting.  I'd liken it to FF14.\n--Facial animations are an abomination and I would consider them worse than ME:Andromeda.  MEA just got more flack because of how great the first trilogy was and how hyped the whole experience had been.\n--The above two items pair together really poorly to make wonky voices that are nowhere near lining up with facial animations and half the time don't appear to even be trying to.\n--Character is off-centered substantially by camera and at a low angle so it feels like you're almost trailing behind them on foot rather than 'playing as'\n--No way to turn off mouse acceleration\n--I experienced numerous problems with multiplayer lobbies and staying connected.\n--Any time a person joins a session the difficulty goes right up to the 400% max. There is no scaling.  It is either solo, or 400%.  So you're boned if you do a partial party.\n--I felt very mislead about when I could actually do multiplayer.  Several things told me I could and instructed me how, but it actually took a *substantial* number of quests before I was allowed to legitimately do parties/multiplayer.  I would not have minded if they had just delayed it period rather than telling me I could but it didn't work.\n\nOVERALL:\nIt's partially pretty, and really confusing that they waited a year to come out with *this* for a full 60.

The perfect grind game. Historically known for having delightful amounts of content shoved into such a small space that you can somehow justify having a console specifically for one of their games. \n\nHopefully I can be as brief as possible with this but it is absolutely atrocious that a game that is about hunting can have more mechanics and equipment tailored to specific ways to accomplish practically anything related to survival, AND have more equipment diversity and item purpose than any survival game that could ever hope to exist... While not being a survival game. \n\nBack to the point. Monster Hunter is like a vast painting that has you searching for Waldo, except that there is more than one. And while the typical person will find Waldo and move on. The people who appreciate the art and stick around to find that there are a whole lot of Waldos just strolling around just shy of plain sight. Everything about the game can be made into fun with a little know how.\n\nUnfortunately, this review isn't about monster hunter, it's about Monster Hunter World.\n-Monster Hunter World is a Fantastic game set to appeal to the masses, delivering much more fluid combat, Crystalline attention to detail, admirable amounts of content, easy to start co op, An array of weapons to choose from and adapt to, and skills to support every set up and idea. \n\nPlease stick around for the rest if you read this, because I am going to start with the bad. Monster Hunter World made a big mistake (In my opinion). The things you would normally go out and kill monsters for has been trivialized beyond recognition. The shortest way I can describe this to you is, Imagine if a good game had several seasons of content, and the content costs nothing now so they make the entire game laughably easy to catch you up so you can get to the content they can gouge you for. But instead of there being content at the end, it's RNG, and instead of the game being old and full of content, it's brand new, and has very little at the end. \n-Do not mistake me, I LOVE this game, But growing up, half of the mettle was getting a crew of able willed hunters together to slay, and in most cases, dismantle a monster to craft its armor. Where half the battle is people using traps so none of us have to constantly flank the monster, or breaking several wings to make a piece of equipment... Monster Hunter World made practically every item but gems and plates, and choice irritants like Vaal Hazak's fang or Nergigante's tail, EXTREMELY easy to obtain without severing or breaking. The whole point of Monster Hunter is enjoying the methodical turn of the thickest solution of delicious thoughtful and well excecuted content... And Monster Hunter World literally pours water in it to make it easier to mix up. But it doesn't taste the same.\n-In a month or so, Everyone on PC will be farming Kulve Taroth to get some of, if not mostly the best weapons available in the game in another slog of RNG delivered progression. Weapons that mostly outclass or replace what weapons you wasted your time earning. And because it is a limited time quest, once it is gone, you will be left with inferior weapons to chase, or more RNG supported decoration farming... The general content climate of this series departure makes absolutely no sense to me. \n\nMoving on...\nGOOD STUFF! Monster Hunter World Is a graphical marvel and overall sight to see, the game and many of its assets are top notch, animations are mostly fluid, and performance is almost perfect now that teostra's fire has been fixed, There are a few lighting hiccups here and there, but that's on my end.\n-The quests are more involved, and only require brute force and VERY little know how to complete, you won't be catching fish or killing copious amounts of raptors because you're hoping you don't need to kill big bad Tigrex to boost your hunter rank. (It isn't always a good thing.)\n-SOS flares! No more looking outside of the ad hoc party seeing a few minute men wave at the screen and then make and destroy half a dozen houses so you can open your room and help them out. \n-General quality of life changes, infinite tent and item box access, being able to eat mid mission, the entire slinger mechanic...\n-Free DLC Updates, New monsters, gear. \n\nThey said they were going to make it accessible for everyone, and they sure did. Monster Hunter World is an undeniable addition to the roster of games. There is a lot to do, and fun to be had. You will fully enjoy this game without issue until you hit the endgame, at that point I recommend you make some friends or answer some SOS flares. unless you are patient enough to wait for more content.\n-To be fair, other games exist, and there are other things to do. But I hope the developers know that our tastebuds have demanded a king's ransom after experiencing the reimagining of a game we used to pour our lives into decades ago, so as much as I want to cry and complain that my game changed a little, and I miss the old days.

These are cons, and I understand why people might dislike/hate this game because of this, maybe also the 14 weapon types that are hard to get along with initially, and mastering them might be even harder, as there are a few combos that you can only get through trial and error (or by watching/reading guides).

The weapon and armor designs also take a big hit in the pursuit of this \"grounded\" approach. A lot of the designs, even for some returning equipment have a \"bone or metal with monster parts glued on\" look to them which I think is pretty awful.\n\nA lot of the quality of life changes make the game a lot more accessible to newcomers but some of the changes feel like a step in the wrong direction. Having guides for monsters weaknesses and strengths built into the game is great. Being able to drink potions while moving is fine, especially since it actually takes longer to fully heal compared to the old [instant heal > flex] and you can also be interrupted in the middle of healing, sometimes resulting in a wasted potion. Decorations being random drops instead of charms makes filling out your set less painful in theory since you're only rolling for a random skill and not a skill, amount of skill points, and deco slots, but it feels like you need to be constantly doing events or end-game quests to have a good chance at getting what you really need... While the new skill system is more streamlined, it's also just plain dumbed down; the lack of negative skills and skill activation removes the risk and thought involved in building a set. Some of the weapon changes add more depth, but in some cases like longsword, hammer, and charge blade so much has been added or changed that parts of, or the entire original identity of the weapon is no longer intact. Kinsect upgrading for insect glaive is a lot more painless, but the old system gave you more freedom over your insect's stats. Mantles add some extra strategy to the game in theory, but in practice most of them are just direct upgrades to your character with a cooldown. Having multiple starting points that you can fast travel to during quests without having to pop a farcaster helps out with the maps being generally bigger, but removes any of the extra challenge of randomly getting dropped in the middle of nowhere later on in high rank, and presumably master rank as well in Iceborne. And WHERE is the disembodied voice saying \"So Tasty!\" when you cook a well done steak? hmmm??\n\nThe maps range from \"alright\" to \"almost bad\" I think the order of not terrible to worst is: Elder Recess > Wildspire Waste >>> Ancient Forest = Coral Highlands = Rotten Vale. Behemoth is a pretty cool crossover but the fight is just okay in practice. The arch tempered elder dragon endgame has maybe two of seven fights that have some actual thought put into them, the rest either having big inflated damage and sometimes new moves/mechanic changes that make the fight insufferable to go through.\n\nAbove all other issues I have the greatest sin of this game is the limited time events. Its like they tried to lean more into the MMO aspect of the game and they did it in the worst way possible. Seasonal events and the cosmetic stuff are nice, but locking fights with weapons and armor behind them that are not only good, but in just about every case the best gear for a weapon type is ridiculous. It puts forth the idea that \"you should play the game when we tell you to, or else you'll be behind everyone else who does\" which is ridiculous. In previous games event quests could be initiated at any time with the only restriction possibly being your hunting rank.\n\nI think Monster Hunter World lacks the soul of previous Monster Hunter games. It tries to move the series forward but in many ways goes backwards, maybe sideways in some cases. If you can get past that it's a perfectly adequate entry in the series, but if I have dissuaded you from getting this or you've played this and are looking for something different, and you have the means of playing them, check out some of the older games. Freedom Unite, Portable 3rd, 3 Ultimate, 4 Ultimate, and Generations Ultimate are all pretty solid as far as I know and have played.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44053971", "timestamp_created": 1533938770, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1574316024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 341, "playtime_forever": 21108, "steamid": "76561198043566132", "num_reviews": 82}, "timestamp_updated": 1572344209, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534841299057006836", "review": "GO HERE KILL THIS\nGO HERE KILL THAT\n200 hours later and still fun", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "54725406", "timestamp_created": 1566349363, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579458926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1463, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 29610, "steamid": "76561198023576369", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1566349363, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534794270992279053", "review": "I have played monster hunter before on psp but I have no idea how to play it.

Monster Hunter World is undeniably a great game if you like the core gameplay formula for MH, but it is FAR from perfect. As I'm sure you're well aware, the multiplayer system is a complete mess - why do cutscenes stop us from playing together? They never have in previous games.\n\"You have not progressed far enough in the story to accept this quest.\" Oh, great, so I can't actually progress through the story with my friends then? Yeah, in the past, you had to do urgents four times in a row, but at least you could do them with your friends together...\nWhy are item sets gone? They were a nice thing to have...\n\nIf you don't mind mainly playing solo, then this game is absolutely worth your time. The monsters are interesting and unique, and they interact with their environment in a really compelling way. There are a few aspects of the core gameplay that I feel need work, such as the fact that the mounting UI seems completely broken, and half the time you can't actually do the powerful finisher attack from the monster's back.\n\nThe port is... Passable, but certainly not up to standard considering how long they made us wait for it. The optimisation is extremely lacking, and there are a few options missing from the graphics menu - motion blur, depth of field and bloom effects cannot be turned down/off.\nAlso, there is no option to change from XBox button icons to PS4 icons, which is a bit annoying considering the X is the same colour on an XBox One controller as on a PS4 one, but they're totally different buttons. On that note - definitely give the game a miss if you don't have a controller, because the keyboard and mouse controls are a complete mess as well.\n\nThis game is very good and I would recommend it if you don't mind some of the frustrating elements. It's just unfortunate, because it could have been fantastic if they'd fixed some of the issues it has.

If this is the new direction for the Monster Hunter series, I fully support their decision.\n\n So many quality of life changes that it almost brings a tear to my eye, such as:\n     being able to move while drinking potions and consumables\n     actually being able to dodge while carrying wyvern/herbivour eggs\n     changing gear while out in the field\n     being able to eat a meal out in the field for passive buffs(no longer have to worry about forgetting before a big hunt)\n     no Blademaster and Gunner armor sets\n and the list goes on\n\none of my favorite things about the amount of detail that they put into each area is the endemic life and how you can capture them to display in your home. it truly brings out the Pokemon complex in me, i always keep my net equiped just in case i run into a new little creature to add to my collection\n\nnow i know most other hunters out there that have played previous MH games have been showing their disdain for the lack of G rank, though i know, as with previous monster hunter games, they will release G rank for monster hunter world, and since it is on pc, xbone, and ps4 they will most likely do it as expansion that you can purchase instead of what they previously had to do which was rereleasing the as an Ultimate or G version.\n\nmy review for MHW may be a little biased but that is because i had the pleasure to watch this series grow into the wonderful world it has become over the year, but if you truly wish to appreciate and enjoy this game, i strongly reccomend finding your way to the [url=https://adoptahunter.org/]Adopt-A-Hunter[/url] program which was officially recognized by Capcom before the initial release on consoles\n\nthe game may have some optimization issues but overall they did a decent job for their first main series Monster Hunter release on PC\n\ntldr;\n     Great Game, can't wait to see what comes next in the main series", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44755758", "timestamp_created": 1537053406, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579083381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 245, "num_games_owned": 490, "playtime_forever": 16262, "steamid": "76561198024986883", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1537053406, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534303665161132813", "review": "Good game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44142095", "timestamp_created": 1534252379, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580113741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 7166, "steamid": "76561198284036732", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1578320213, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534288644790649414", "review": "Finally a new MonHun!\n\nPros:\nTook the old formula and brought it into the next generation.\n\nCons:\nPoorly optimized for PC.\n\nBuy it!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44788615", "timestamp_created": 1537220995, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1564157255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_forever": 7237, "steamid": "76561198014461660", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1542833620, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534288406372070313", "review": "Servers are so fucked that its impossible to play with friends.

Amazing game,  first quality port in years,  incredibly well optimized for how pretty it looks, occasional stutter when 1 specific dragon spams the screen. Online connectivity issues that cause a DC once every 7 hunts or so. A valve issue that's being worked on. Best title this year. Easily.]\n\nLet me start this off with the following statement:\nI don't get surprised by many things in life.\n\nYet somehow almost every aspect of this game from development to launch has surprised the hell out of me.\n\nWhen capcom said that they'd be releasing this title for PC, I expected it far down the line. Monster hunters don't get released soon enough. August release wasn't even considered for me. \n\nWhile being released, there were dozens of people making such bold statements as: \"This uses Denuvo? I'm not buying\" which surprised the hell out of me again. Some passionate people even posted negative reviews for the use of denuvo. That's got to be band wagon,  right? As an adult willing to support the franchise it surprisingly doesn't matter to me if the game is DRM or not. I imagine the category of people complaining would like to see a game non DRM? With literally tens of thousands that just downloaded the game free? I'll never understand why this was ever anyone's concern or problem of you're enjoying the game as designed.\n\nUpon release, the game was incredible.  It ran perfectly smooth on high settings with my 1060, and has consistently shocked me over how incredible the game looks without tanking my medium end machine. There are reviews of people well below reasonable setups complaining of how demanding the game is.  Sorry? I feel for you. But this game? Amazing port.  I doubt making a review about performance on a shoddy machine is a legitimate review.\n\nThe online, if it were a but more consistent,  would be game changing.  The entire story can be completed with friends. They can drop in at any time and help the progress of any active quest using either SOS flares, or manual joining via quest board. I haven't played a game where playing with others was that easy. \n\nSpeaking of playing with others leads me to my next point. Online is unreliable.  The GAME, which I imagine anyone bothering to right a review would base their opinion on, is stellar.  The connectivity issue that VALVE(not sure why you're writing negatively about Capcom and not them.) causes is annoying,  sure. Bur enough to say that it's a bad game? Ridiculous.  Especially considering that \"Lukeda14yroldSasukemain\"s negative review of the game blaming connectivity issues has invested well over 100 hours into a \"bad\" game.\n\n*Pizza is incredible.  Sometimes I can't share it with my friends because the uber eats guy dropped their portions while delivering.  Because of this the pizza suddenly tastes horrible.  I'll write a negative yelp review and never site the driver. Now excuse me while I order the same pizza for 150 hours. Why? Because it's delicious.  Bad pizza though.*\n\nThat sounds brain dead to me. Yet it's literally 90% of the negative reviews. \n\nThen there's the kid with way too much money that's upset that running the game on three 4k screens at once on ultra settings while bit coin mining in the back ground only nets 46 fps instead of 60. I can kind of understand this negative review. You paid a lot of money for your set up. But the game looks and runs smoother than its console counterpart so I'm not sure what you want. I also imagine that adults having this issue are just fine with not running the game ultra on three monitors. Only entitled brats could bother stating: \"My computer can't run this game in \"Real71f3p\". As a gamer looking for a positive gaming experience,  I don't consider that an actual issue.\n\nDude who wrote the review about investing 60 hours to have his save deleted? He's legit. I'll leave him be. That's a pretty honest reason to be upset.\n\nAll in all this game is insane. Fantastic port, fantastic content, attention to detail is overwhelming at times,  and it all runs so damn well. I saw a trail of ants carrying a monster part. I saw the little iguana raptors flee once enough of them are picked off. I see them get brave when their primary predator has been incapacitated.  There's pet collection, Quest collection, a complex skill structure that makes hyper interesting builds,  and a shocking amount of free upcoming content. Each weapon is like playing a new game. Each habituated is lush, interesting, unique, and an absolute joy to traverse. At no point do I feel confined to a small premade space, or cursed to wander endlessly through an open world environment. The quality of life choices in this game are enough to exceed any expectations I could've had for It.,\n\nAnd the pet system? You can catch ants. You can put your pets(The ants) in your home.  You can literally come home to a floor full of ants.  That's crazy.  If something gets game of the year over this, I'm going to be very upset.\n\nMonster hunter has always been niche.  I'm glad it now has it's time in the public eye. Just wish so many confused people understood the point if reviewing a GAME. \n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44254689", "timestamp_created": 1534691081, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579148494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "num_games_owned": 227, "playtime_forever": 9405, "steamid": "76561198069537369", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1534691081, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534229040145874023", "review": "The handler is hot", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "47827469", "timestamp_created": 1545806601, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1548717717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 1096, "steamid": "76561198084219011", "num_reviews": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1545806601, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534227252006530762", "review": "game has done a 180 since release and has gotten better many times. i come back to this game many times and hunt monsters with the boys. very good game\n\n\n\n------everything below this line is a review of when the game initially released on pc------\ni love this game 10/10\nnetwork connection 1/10\n\nwhat i did to fix it: \n- port forwarded\n- turned off firewall (even though i whitelisted my whole (E:). all games installed on e drive)\n- setting my steam friends & chat as offline\n- joining and hosting sessions using session id only and not joining on friends\n- windowed borderless (because fullscreen alt tabbing crashes the game and d/c everyone from the session)\n\nif everyone did this, it would fix the issue. the problem is that this is an issue in the first place\n\nwould i recommend the game to a friend? only if they're willing to do everything i did above yeah, otherwise no", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44287694", "timestamp_created": 1534831949, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579583378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 566, "num_games_owned": 176, "playtime_forever": 22445, "steamid": "76561198273536795", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1575193986, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534117639064788818", "review": "This is fun to play and explore with friends", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "46255351", "timestamp_created": 1542884907, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1569162642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 328, "playtime_forever": 7564, "steamid": "76561198054220204", "num_reviews": 39}, "timestamp_updated": 1542884907, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534054100513458252", "review": "Doesn't run.

The most important thing is that everywhere feels alive. The base(Astera), along with the music never feels like a chore to walk around like most games. The ambience, animal behaviors and everything is connected to each other like an actual ecosystem.\nThe best part are the fights. Unlike most games you truly feel like fighting something, the animations and actions of both you and monsters have weight to them. There are a wide variety of weapons too choose for your liking, and each monster is unique in their attacks and physiologies that you have to strategize against them with armor, weapons, items, traps and so on before each hunt.

Almost. The basic premise of an open world game where you just hunt and kill massive monsters and make stuff with the drops is really fun and indeed, most of the time in game it IS fun. However, in pretty much every other aspect, the game falls apart hard.\n\nClearly, MH:W is made to be played multiplayer. Yet they make playing multiplayer as annoying as can be. Almost every single main story mission (more on this later) has useless cutscenes scattered throughout them, and you CAN'T have anyone in your game with you until you have gotten through each and every cutscene in the given mission. So instead of bringing a group of people through a mission, you need to start the mission solo, progress through until you've exhausted the pointless cutscenes, at which point you have to launch an SOS Flare and have people join mid mission. THIS IS NOT FUN, OR CONVENIENT.\n\nMH:W's story is garbage. Its one of the worst, most boring, tacked on stories I've ever attempted playing through. The characters are annoying and useless, and they make EVERYTHING happen in long, drawn out, unskippable cutscenes that really just serve to waste your time. If they had just cut away any and all story elements from this game, and released a free roam, open world monster hunting game, it would have been a much better experience.\n\nFinally, the tutorials. The game makers felt the need to bloat the hell out of this game with every single possible system that could possibly be fit into an RPG. People might see this and say, \"you're just dumb; everything in this game is tutorialized\" to which I say, correct. Each and every system, of which there are so many, has a \"tutorial\" that amounts to a page or 2 of text that you have to read through, then close before using said system. YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ANY OF THIS. It's almost worse that they even have these pop up tutorial windows because you just get so fed up with them (if you're like me) that you just end up desperately mashing your way through them to play the game, after you've already wasted your time on unskippable cutscenes, slow moving escort missions, and useless character dialogue that you don't care about.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44775222", "timestamp_created": 1537144368, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1536039791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 1680, "steamid": "76561198078304175", "num_reviews": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1579590629, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53350299596786499", "review": "Just started playing the game, ran away from lizards, came back with big sword to kill lizards, then a bigger lizard came and I killed it too, then got slammed by a T-rex and instakilled.\n\n 10/10 would hunt again", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "52672656", "timestamp_created": 1561940528, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3119, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 16621, "steamid": "76561198068512831", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1561940611, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533482134342193604", "review": "good game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "48812850", "timestamp_created": 1549507553, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579784110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "num_games_owned": 1734, "playtime_forever": 14002, "steamid": "76561198002199179", "num_reviews": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1549507553, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533468544483184814", "review": "At the time of writing this review I have fallen in love with this game.

In it's current state, the difficulty scales for multiplayer and sadly doesn't take the ammount of players into account. A monster has the same stats if you fight it with 2 players as it does with 4 players, which means that 2 player missions take the longest time and I often ask myself \"Why am I doing this Quest with a buddy, if I could be so much faster on my own?\". The upcoming Expansion titled \"Iceborn\" will fix that by adding a 2-player scaling, as well as some other fixes they have announced. \n\nAnother thing I should mention is the active modding community that adds their own touch on the game, which can be anything from memey re-skins of monsters and music replacements, to gorgeous looking armor set transmogrifications.

I did have one visual bug, but it disappeared when I relaunched the game.\n\nPC specs:\nAMD FX-8120 (from 2011)\nAMD Radeon R9 390 (from 2015)\n16GB RAM\nSome crappy OCZ SSD\nDualShock 3", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44061076", "timestamp_created": 1533969044, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580104424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2727, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 22491, "steamid": "76561197970146196", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1533969044, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533073961734771729", "review": "Good Shit gang gang lets go!!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44028809", "timestamp_created": 1533851229, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1560834374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 2565, "steamid": "76561198054450598", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1533851229, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532967031002044678", "review": "I enjoy the progression system, and the gameplay", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44052875", "timestamp_created": 1533934440, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1534446122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 350, "playtime_forever": 912, "steamid": "76561198013568852", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1533934440, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 8, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532959580421447754", "review": "I bought Monster Hunter World at launch.  It is a decent game, but it is not worth $60.  Only get it if you're a die hard Monster Hunter fan.  The PC version is a straight up console port, with no consideration for the PC user.  Game is poorly optimized, graphics are pretty disappointing, but the worst aspects are the camera and controls.  There's some shitty mouse acceleration going on that you can't turn off, the camera locking thing is pretty useless and clunky.  If you are a pc gamer, you'll notice the flaws immediately. \n\nNow onto the shitty aspects of the game that isn't due to it being a port.\n\nUnskippable long cutscenes - There's almost 30 minutes of cutscenes before you get to play at all.\nBtw, the game doesn't automatically save for you if you begin a quest, so if you crash to desktop during the first quest, have fun rewatching the cutscenes again. \n\nMultiplayer - I purchased this game with the intention of playing coop with my friend.  The multiplayer interface is not intuitive at all.   You will never see another player in your town, except at the gathering hub, and even then they have to be in the same session as you.  There's a bunch of shit that you have to try out to get multiplayer working.  Worst of all, you can't even do the story quests together without watching the cutscenes that are only available AFTER you've started the quest.  The game doesn't tell you this, and just gives you some msg that states you aren't on the same quest, which is clearly not true.  Oh btw, there are random disconnects happening every 10-15 mins or so too.\n\nTLDR: It's an ok game if you just want to play single player or a die hard Monster Hunter fan.\n\n\n", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44060170", "timestamp_created": 1533965264, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1567464166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 7039, "steamid": "76561197961265308", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1533965264, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532953143119812012", "review": "I just want to hunt monsters with my friends \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstead, get disconnected in the middle of fights, leaving me demotivated, demoralized, and depressed", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44225472", "timestamp_created": 1534583828, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1561362808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 3180, "steamid": "76561198068671235", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1534583916, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532934129238128662", "review": "Cats cook your food.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44347126", "timestamp_created": 1535104199, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1537334117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_forever": 10162, "steamid": "76561198068938961", "num_reviews": 27}, "timestamp_updated": 1535104199, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532918751239776611", "review": "140 hours in game before iceborn, love it amazing game, incredible experience for a low spec pc player, and now iceborne is out and it is killing me with 100% CPU usages, forcing me to either updating the spec or getting a new pc for it, costing it may more than i expected, rating from 10/10 mhw lover to a -10/10 haters, please be prepared before releasing something that would actually ruin a gamer decision.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "61655409", "timestamp_created": 1578707290, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5651, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 14261, "steamid": "76561198111107300", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1578707290, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532910406589508057", "review": "If you're ever planning on playing this you're better off using a controller since the mouse movement is just horrible", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44282106", "timestamp_created": 1534800351, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1534717980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 85, "steamid": "76561198164122666", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1534800351, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532897412776947021", "review": "WASTED MY FUCKING MONEY.

It's bad enough the game has a jarring issue where a co-op partner cannot join you unless a person has finished a cutscene and various other odd design choices. \n\nThe multi-player here seems to be designed largely around occasional escapades with random people and isn't a seemless experience if you're trying to play the campaign with a budy at the same time. You end up having to wait for each individual person to finish all their cutscenes before you can even join their fight making the experience seem very disjointed. In short, as a multi-player game, it falls short mainly due to strange design choices. \n\nAs a PC port, I'd have to say it's only passable.

Simply jump in enjoy the barbaric ale chugging and excessively large amounts of food consumed!!\n\nThe Weapons all feel smooth wonderful and all are easy to get into hard to master each weapon feels like a different game!\n\nThe game looks amazing, but I will admit the weapons could use a little more creativity in terms of design...\n\nNow for anyone who has played previous monsters hunters will know that this game is somewhat easier than previous monster hunters, this is either a good thing if your new or a lil upsetting if you had that love/hate to getting wiped 100 times throughout your playthourgh, you grew a connection to that monster it became your rival and when you finally beat it, finally got its set and came back to it later and wiped the floor with it, oh the satisfaction!!!\n\nI'm not the worst hunter but im not the best and I only carted around 10 times. \n(during the campaign)\n\nI cannot really complain about the amount of monsters in the game as they had to make every single monster new hd models attacks personality and with iceborne coming, I dont think we will have to worry about lack of monsters for long!\n\nAlright I think thats enouph praise and glory lets hit the shit that bugs me,\n\nSessions and hosting em, I understand this is capcoms first pc game... but come on how hard is it to make a decent singleplayer session menu creation.\n\nNetworking used to be a problem, but from what I can tell its for the most part fixed\n\nA lot of people were complaining about not being able to run it with 1060's and im over here wtih a radeon r9200 running it at 60 frames on medium graphics so, I idk what thats about update your graphic drives...\n\nand my #1 Biggest pet peeve with this game is the fact that you can only see other players in the gathering hall/ship at the top of the map, why they did this I dont know. Its a minor thing but damn is it annoying!!\n\nOverall, Wonderful game with more content on the way in autumn 2019!\nFor seasoned hunters this game may get a little dull with the difficulty being lowered while generations ultimate on the nintendo switch is the opposite. Shit throws you into the fire drenched in gasoline... (so I have been told.)\nBut if your new to the series, this game is wonderful and dont let thew whole difficulty thing tunr you away, Arch Tempered monsters are there and waiting and high teir and yes oh yes! they will introduce you to mr cart! while you may blow through the low teir campaign and hunts and maybe even the high teir your going to hit a wall of fuckery that will mow you down and eat you alive! and its glorious!!!!! \nJust make sure your gpu is up to date!! good luck and happy hunting!!!!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44027398", "timestamp_created": 1533846802, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580133911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3235, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 25481, "steamid": "76561198119079156", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1544769919, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531665802001953125", "review": "The matchmaking is about to make me ask for a refund.

There's one reason to not rec this game that matters.\n\nThe core gameplay isn't fun enough. Monster fights are pretty fun. But even during a fight there is a lot of boring unfun stuff. The monster runs away. A lot. You spend a good chunk of the fun part of your gametime not having fun. Because you are running around after the monster. There's no feeling of excitement because you can't fucking hit him while he's running effectively and you aren't punished if you screw around catching up (in my limited exp). \n\nYou also spend time sharpening your weapon.

You watch and learn the moves of giant beasts that can crush you in 1 hit if you fail to predict their next move and dodge or block them. It's like Tera, without the ridiculous restrictions of mmorpgs.\n\n- Tons of variety in weapons and armor that you can craft out of the monsters you defeat.\n\n- A good amount of monsters to fight on normal and high difficulty, and even higher difficulty (tempered)\n\n- 5 big worlds that make the game seem spacious enough.\n\n- Tons of craftable consumeables that can be made from gathering plants , animals, and other small items in the world. (it gives a less \nintense feeling of acheiving stuff than just \"big monster fighting 24-7\"\n\n- Talking to NPCs actually helps you. People like the botanist will craft up to 3 materials at a time for you if you complete their quests to get their progress up. The armory lady will give you better mantles after you complete her quests. ( Mantles like fireproof, ghille, rocksteady, etc.)\n\nCons:\n- You have to mix match armor to get the desired armor effects. And you end up looking ugly as hell through most of the game. Wearing 1 set that matches will handicap you. And the color dye options absolutely suck. It lets you change the color of the LEAST dominant colors.\n\n- The grind to get jewels is a little stupid, because they're completely random. You can have hundreds and hundreds of hours in the game and still never find enough of the jewel you're looking for to properly make a build revolving around that jewel's effect.\n\n- The chat system is almost dead. Not many people talk during the games because there is no lobby where we can see world chat. All we can see is the chat during the TIMED missions, or during intense monster fights, so nobody uses it as much, since they want to complete the mission in time, or not die. Nobody uses the gathering hub,  which is our closest thing to a lobby.\n\n- We can't see eachother in world unless we make conscious effort to travel to the gathering hub which doesn't have any of the useful NPC in it that most people talk to before every mission.\n\n- There's no world chat, and there's only 16 people per session. 16 people that we can't even see until we check the player list.  I thought that the PC version of this game would be more social than dead ass ps4, but it was exactly the same.  The sentences only allow us to type about 1 line before it cuts off the rest of what we typed, there's no time to type during timed missions, and there's no main chats like most online games have.\n\nWE NEED a world chat. And we need to be able to join the sessions of players from the world chat. Don't limit us to 16 solo player, silent nomads, every time we play this game. This truly is the worst thing about the game if you ask me. Knowing that there are 16 other players who probably won't see what you typed because the chat system is so bad in this game, nobody pays attention to it. We don't socialize. We just pop up a SOS flare and hope someone joins and then silently defeats the monster with us and never gets seen again.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "45011303", "timestamp_created": 1538267894, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579735599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 19702, "steamid": "76561198036732787", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1538268444, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531320393085479736", "review": "Being a huge fan of the series and having invested multiple thousand hours in former games Like Tri , 3U and 4U , seeing how well the series did on stronger consoles / PC makes me very happy .

I have played Tri, 3U, 4U and Generations. This review, if mentioning the older games, will be in referance to those.\n\nMonster Hunter World is a great game to start at if you are new to the series. It revamped some things, which makes the game slightly less complicated than previous games. That being said, there is still alot to learn as a beginner. The game is somewhat cluttered. Theres a ton of little things to learn and remember, which veterans take for granted in just knowing from experience. I feel, though, that any beginner can easily pick these things up with time and practice.\n\nAs far as this game being \"too easy\", I think it's relative. I felt this game to be easier than previous games, but it could also be because I am used to the delayed movements, constant need to roll and dodge, repeated movesets of certain monsters that was used in previous games, and the million little things to remember when it came to items, armor, weapons, the canteen, etc. I think its an awesome game, and I think its a fun challenge that will be fulfilling and rewarding for new and old players.\n\nDespite all this, Monster Hunter was always a game I hesitated to confidently recommend to others. It isn't because it's a bad game; it's a wonderful game. It is because it *can* be a grindfest, and I know that is a deal breaker for some people. I personally don't mind that about it at all, but after thinking about it for a bit, came to a conclusion of who I think would like that aspect:\n\nIf you are the kind of person that does not mind repetative actions, sometimes tediously, as long as its to reach a goal (game advancement, new armor or new weapons), then you will probably love this game.\n\nIf you are the kind of person that does not like repeating things of any kind, irregardless of what it brings you, then I think this game would annoy the crap out of you. Lol!\n\nMonster Hunter has always been known as a game that was a grind in order to get materials for weapons and armor, and for the people that played the game, *thats why they played it*. Part of the joy of Monster Hunter was the work and effort it took in order to FINALLY get that piece of armor and that weapon you've been wanting for ages. If that is you... buy this game. Haha. (Although, I will admit, advancing in the weapon tree is much easier than previous titles IMO, but it still provides a nice challenge!)\n\nAs for other things in this game, the graphics are beautiful (to me), but keep in mind this game is a port. The movements are delayed, as if using a controller, even if you are using a mouse and keyboard. Using multiplayer can be finnicky; people will drop from sessions or quests from time to time, and seeing other peoples quests to join sometimes can be a challenge. But, after playing many many multiplayer missions, I found the problems to be few. This game can also be demanding of your computer, but my computer isn't new and runs just fine, despite a little lag.\n\nAll in all, I love this game. I love the grind, I love the corniness, I love the outrageous armor that makes me look like a meatball half the time.... I just love it.\n\nBut that could be nostolgia speaking. ;) \n\n---------\n\nPreviously Updated Review:\n\nThankfully, the issue was fixed for me and the game now works. I've been playing Monster Hunter for close to a decade, so this being on PC makes me excited. From what I can tell so far, it looks like a wonderful game. Camera angles can be a little wonky, but its nothing bad at all! I hope it continues to work for others so that we can all enjoy this game.\n\n---------\n\nPrevious Review Upon Game Release: \n\nCrashes in the same spot during the intro every time.

BUT with better hitboxes and controls the game also gets \"easier\". thats a \"problem\" in a lot of veterans eyes. i actually like the new feel and i dont think that a game should get more difficult trough technical inaccuracy but rather trough challenging movesets fast moves or interessting mechanics which we have less of because There is no G-rank in this game as of now(exiting mechanics from resent mh games such as the frenzy virus or ferus monsters arent in the game either) . it stops at high rank. Besides that there are far less monsters in this game than in most other titles. still a lot of beasts to fight but not as many as in other games altough they are planing to add more areas, mosnters and gear that comes with it over time. The new monsters range from generic to interestingly designed but they are all woth taking a look atand there are some old monsters that got a new coat of paint gameplay wise. every fight is fun. (except lavafish but we dont talk about him here.) there are a lot of quality of live upgrades to help you jump to the acction faster in the begining and not go back to gathering later on. \nThe skill system has changed quite a bit but i dont want to touch on that here and there are a good amount oif guides out there. long story short Charms are now random while you have to get your decos via random drop of a certain kind of new quest variant. the good skill decos have tramendusly low droprates and it can be a pain to get them. not if your lucky ofcourse. but this actually helps the game stay alive because with the lack of a lot of mosnters there is also less quest and gear to farm (as of the time of me writing this) than you may remember from other games. it deffinatly has less content but in my opinion that mostly because the cut out most of the annoying gathering quets. they are still there but a lot less tha before. the game also puts a good bit of focus when it comes to exploring the new areas since they are way more interactive than ever before. mosnters live and hunt like animal you are no longer ther center of attention.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44618854", "timestamp_created": 1536343947, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580079356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1049, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 26457, "steamid": "76561198112290828", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1536343947, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530164778232574463", "review": "Game has crashed multiple times.

I can't believe that after 10 years, i'm playing monster hunter again. The only bad thing that i could say for MHworld is that Denuvo is a piece of shit. And please capcom, optimize the game properly, don't skirt on us PC players.\n\nWould i recommend this game? Yes and No\nYes, if you want something new to try on. Keep in mind, Changing weapons in this game will change your playstyle! There are no \"Best\" weapons just different playstyles. Never box yourself with the idea that you can only main 1 or 2 weapons. this game is your hunting sandbox. Kill or Capture, do whatever you like. an example is when i hit Hunter Rank 7 i was getting kinda bored with my Longsword so i changed my weapon to Switchaxe (because i refuse to touch my favourite Greatsword without the best equipment) and that refreshed my love again for the game.\n\nI don't recommend this for people who are going to try and approach this as another \"souls\" game.

This is for anyone who plans to play with one or more dedicated friends overseas.\n\nGenerally, playing from Australia can wind up in massive lag and latency issues when connecting to US servers - as MH:W is peer-to-peer (like similar title GOD EATER), this is largely avoided!\nIn gameplay experience, the game registers your actions and monster's reactions in real-time, rather than the frustrating desync/resync hit and movement lag you classically have to deal with on dedicated overseas servers.\n\nWhile menu navigation is a little bit confusing at first, it's pretty easy to learn, and setting up parties is fairly simple, if not requiring a little workaround with setup and session IDs if the automatic matchmaker fails.\n\nController support is fantastic, unsurprising given this is a PC port of a console title, though I can understand the complaints with the keyboard and mouse controls - they feel fairly floaty or fidgety at times.\nI highly reccomend getting a controller to play this game for the best experience.\n\nA few pros about the New Character (customization/tutorial experience):\n- Customization offers a wide array of choices (averaging 14-24 choices per section)\n- You can select different lighting within the customization screen to better judge character's colour\n- Opacity/metallic/gloss effects are available for tattoos, scars and makeup, which is surprisingly rare for choice\n- 20 different \"voice presets\" to choose from, coupled with a helpful Action Sample section for best results\n- Post-creation you can change a few aspects of your character for free at your House's Item Box (hair style, colour)\n\nA few cons, including my two biggest problems with the early experience:\n- You CANNOT skip the tutorial, or any of their cutscenes, effectively making new characters slog through a roughly 15-25 minute section of the game before even picking up a weapon\n- Slider options are there, but have fairly minimal impact on the character's relevant features (no pug noses!)\n- Customization after creation is not free, which considering there's only one area in the game you can actually sit down and look at other player's characters, strikes me as incredibly odd to actually charge for", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45168648", "timestamp_created": 1538969786, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1577437591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 299, "playtime_forever": 17541, "steamid": "76561198054949718", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1538969786, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528571426868438721", "review": "Games good now", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44364870", "timestamp_created": 1535185011, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580019947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 783, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 11890, "steamid": "76561198014400936", "num_reviews": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1538848154, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528541803359985352", "review": "Solid just solid aside from the connection problems... and kirin", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44243366", "timestamp_created": 1534650843, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578706267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 107, "playtime_forever": 8519, "steamid": "76561198198306378", "num_reviews": 25}, "timestamp_updated": 1534650843, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528505384922027588", "review": "I made a mistake and got dauntless before Monster Hunter World was announced.

I had first heard of the series a long time ago, but never had the opportunity to try it out. When I heard about the series again, I was playing a Beta for Dauntless. With Dauntless being my first exposure the Monster Hunting Formula, I was completely blown away with Monster Hunter World from the beginning. \n\nFor the uninitiated you are a Monster Hunter, and the monsters you hunt are massive creatures. These monsters require skill to track, fight, and take down. Each and every fight can be a fight for your very life.\n\nAs you track the creature, you can gather materials for crafting, fish, and capture small creatures, but beware your hunt mark is not the only beast in the area. Other monsters roam the land, some are not dangerous to you, while some are deadly and will even fight your mark for territory.\n\nYou'll of course be aided by a friendly Palico, a cat companion that can offer various means of assistance. Initially, this comes in the form of healing and some light damage. You can equip your Palico with better gear and different gadgets to suit your hunt.\n\nSpeaking of gear, most of the materials you use to craft new armor will be obtained through your hunts. This means to get much of the gear you need to hunt tougher monsters will be by killing other monsters for stats that will offer better resistances, skills, and to better exploit your chosen mark's weaknesses.\n\nThe fights themselves can range wildly in approach depending on your weapon and fighting  style is. With 16 weapon types and traps at your disposal, there is a lot of options to suit your desire. I personally swapped between Hammer, and a Bow which offered were dramatically different even when fighting the same monster.\n\nWhile I got to the 4th zone solo, I did foray into Multiplayer to answer a SOS Flare. This flare is something a player can use to call reinforcements to help if you are feeling a little outclassed. You can opt to form a party for more persistent experience, as SOS Flares are drop in, drop out. I personally did not play the more persistent multiplayer portion.\n\nOverall recommendation is that I recommend Monster Hunter World.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Every Monster feels unique.\n    [*]Palicos.\n    [*]There is lots to see and do, so grinding materials is not so bad because you can do other things at the same time.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Multiplayer can be hit or miss, but haven't had any issues with the missions I have run so far.\n    [*]Until you get a feel for a weapon, difficulty can swing wildly.\n    [*]While unaffected in singleplayer, there were some disconnections to the server.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Nothing glaringly wrong here, as I've finished the first 3 zones solo, but some people that want to avoid MP might find fights too hard to solo.

Screw that overgrown fish.. Because it will hipcheck you to the damn moon, while it's 10 miles away.. God the hitboxes for some of the monsters in the older games.. Dear god. ) and the world and the charm, that just pulls you in, it's all so great i just can't get enough of it. \n\nAnd if i would rate this game, i would give it a solid 10/10, a must buy game, for anyone who would like a fair, but challenging game, where you can feel like an absolute badass, hunting monsters of all shapes and sizes, and a game that has what can be seen as hundreds of hours worth of content.\n\nThough a word of advice, if you have, and can, use a controller, if you want the full experience, and want to be able to play the game to the fullest.

I tried kb/mouse for a bit and it just seemed not designed around it.\n\nDisconnection issues are really rare now aside from a strange issue that happens of the \"B\" button being stuck when you alt tab out of fullscreen mode sporadically -- which can sometimes cause it to just disconnect as well. Not sure what this bug is about, but I like running the game in fullscreen mode to minimize input lag so be cautious about that.\n\nOther than that the game is good if not great but if you're reading this review you likely knew this already and were more curious about the port issues. I can say outside of the alt tabbing on fullscreen there have been no real issues I have run into and they all seem to be fixed, so don't let that be a reason to abstain from this game any longer.\n\n\nEDIT:\nAfter about 300 hours in, the game literally crashed on Xenojiva like I've read for others and corrupted my save, after I recovered that everything was sort of normal, then a couple of days later the game literally freezes on every single large monster hunt rewards screen now, rendering it completely unplayable.\nRather frustrating that you can get this deep into the game before it starts bugging out like mad to make the game this unplayable.\n\nEDIT x2:\nI fixed the game save by literally learning how to parse the data with a hex editor and finding the corrupt sector. That is an absolute joke that I had to do that, this game crashes frequently and this is common -- any game that requires you to backup save files to play without losing literally months worth of data can't get a thumbs up just for technical issues, despite the game otherwise being a 9/10.\n\nEDIT x3:\nSo this was actually an issue with my RAM. That is fine, the game is mostly stable now -- but still, for a game this tied to loot that you have to grind for having no way to recover faulty data is truly frightening. Backup your saves!

That way they give players time to beef up, and eventually the game will be in sync with the console version. Good plan.\n\nAlso, helpful hint.\nTURN OFF VOLUMETRIC FOG. It takes too much of a load on your pc. At max settings I thought I wasn't gonna ever reach 60 fps. But after turning off the fog, it gave me a helpful boost. It's just an odd feature really.\n\nThat's it. Good game.

I play with a 4 year old PC with a GTX 980: I could play on Max settings on 1440p and I get really smooth FPS. (I'm really fussy about fps drops and all that stuff.) Occassionally I get a framedrop when there are a thousand explosions happening at the same time, but honestly every PCs framerate would tank with that.\n\nThere are a few problems with connectivity and stuff. It happens occassionally that you get a connection error and need to restart your game. Honestly that's not such a big deal, because this game loads up pretty quickly and it auto-saves all the time for you.\n\nAt first I was a bit sceptical about this game, I originally didn't plan on buying it, but damn that would've been a big mistake.

I have encountered NO issues at all with this game of any sort, this game takes everything that original monster hunter games have created and improved upon almost all aspects. Monster Hunter: World is a game of skill it is all based around dodging, blocking and timing your attacks, and if it sounds \"too hardcore\" it kinda is. BUT DONT FRET. I dont like super challenging games but this game makes the gameplay feel as fair as possible and it doesnt feel like it is ramping up the difficulty just for the sake of being \"hardcore\". This game makes you really feel like a MONSTER HUNTER, the more that you fight a monster the more that you get better at killing it, after a  few battles with the same monster you really feel like you understand its attack patterns like you have studied it like a real hunter.\n\nNow from looking at the negative reviews I understand that these are the main complaints:\n- the cutscenes are long and boring (dont play this game for the story)\n- the connection in this game is less than working properly (but its not too bad)\n- in order to fight the same monster when you are in singleplayer you have to watch all of the 'cutscenes' (which are basically 5 seconds of showing the monster AND then your friends can join you)\n- the amount of options that you have in the settings menu is disapointing (some guy seriously made his entire review based on this)\n- the multiplayer is a bit weird to set up (in order to play with your friends, one of you has to create a PUBLIC online session  and then have the others join that session AND THEN post a quest for your friends to join aka you have to be in the same session in order to play together)\n- the game is very difficult on your computer (so dont play it if you own a potato) \n- you arent gonna understand the game until about 4 or so hours in (past the refund point)\n\nkeep in mind that many of these issues could be patched out within the coming weeks\n\nAll in all i really like this game, i didnt really like the games in the monster hunter series because there were just too many issues such as you had to craft a pickaxe to mine rocks which was a complete waste of time, and you were in a loading screen a third of the time.

I will probably continue to play it as some fun is salvagable and there is always the hope that some of the more mechanical problems with the port will be fixed, but so far, this game falls short of the monster hunter experience.\n\nPositives:\n+ Diversity of playstyle between weapons seems good, no weapon types feel too similar to each other\n+ Aesthetically gorgeous graphics, even on the lowest settings.  The level design of each area I've been to has been unique and beautiful as well.\n+ It's monster hunter on PC, freeing us from the constraints of the physically painful claw grip.\n+ Quality of life improvements to gathering.  Changes to gathering and the expanded quest inventory get highlights for almost saving this game. \n\nNegatives, split into two sections:\n\nPort issues:\n- Denuvo.  Why any company sees Denuvo and thinks \"yes, this is a great idea\" is beyond me; in reality, it's probably more like \"we know this game is going to sell well regardless of what we do to it because it's monster hunter.\"  Capcom, this is simply irredeemable.\n- Weird motion blur that cannot be turned off and is extremely distracting\n- Random framerate drops to the point of unplayability, even on a very high end PC\n- Awful multiplayer issues - disconnecting from friends in the middle of a quest is commonplace\n\nIssues with the game itself:\n\n-UNSKIPPABLE 'STORY' CUTSCENES.  In Monster Hunter...  Oh, and multiplayer is gated behind seeing these cutscenes.\n\n- Disappointing 'hunting' experience as the tracking of monsters is all but eliminated from the game; if you see the monster once your glowbugs will follow it like a mobile quest marker for the remainder of the hunt\n- Most new monsters are not very charismatic desipte clear attempts at 'quirky design.'  The designers of these monster perhaps forgot that the most charismatic monsters are popular because of their behavior patterns, not just their visual appearance.  And speaking of behavior patterns...\n- It's just too easy, especially in the early game.  I've fainted maybe three times since starting the game, usually trying to fight large monsters in expedition when I first saw them.  It's even easier when playing solo, as monsters have hilariously low HP.  The time limit of 50 minutes is attached to quests for legacy sake; even when first hunting a new monster a novice player will need at most half of that time.  There should be some challenge, even with the first big 'drome' monster - with the Great Jagras, you could literally do anything you want and ignore its every move and still probably kill it without losing more than half of your health.  \n- Many weapons look very similar, and even share models between different upgrade trees.  With so few upgrade trees compared to entries like Freedom Unite, this is a travesty and effort should have been taken to have more distinctive, standout weapon appearances.  As primarily a hammer user I am especially disappointed in the... \"options\" we have.\n- Unfortunately many other aspects have been casualized, from skills (each armor piece now has a skill, rather than having to build skills by wearing multiple armor pieces) to being able to drink potions while walking, to having your felyne companion start with a very strong, unlimited heal.  These things add up and, as mentioned earlier, make the game feel just too easy.\n\nUltimately the game is still Monster Hunter, and is still fun (especially if you have a group of people to play it with), but just barely.  I am worried that this will pave the road for even more simplified Monster Hunter releases with content locked behind paid DLC.  Due to that, and the frankly inexcusable issues with the port quality, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game.  But I'll keep playing (for now), because it's Monster Hunter.  \n\nThat's what Capcom's counting on.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44058484", "timestamp_created": 1533958060, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1536287124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 318, "playtime_forever": 5231, "steamid": "76561197995894293", "num_reviews": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1533958508, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527350425720214844", "review": "Classic capcom port.

Every part of the monster has its own hit point pool.  You can wail on a single part of the monster and break it (or stagger the monster!).  You can focus the head to break it and send the monster reeling.  You can cut off tails.  Now (unlike before), you can see battle damage on the monsters as you beat them to ribbons, higher fidelity graphics and textures, and added features like heart rate monitors, capture guru, and quick deploy traps included for everyone!\n\nThere are 14 different weapon types, each with at least 15 different weapon trees to choose from.  The weapon types all come with extremely different features and play style.  I don't think anyone could play them all and say they didn't feel compelled to play at least one of them.  I have more of a struggle to pick \"only a handful\" to focus on, because of crafting cost and resources.  Ranged weapons, melee weapons, shield weapons, technical weapons.  There are weapons of so many types, someone who just wants to be able to spam one button and doge can do it!  Meanwhile, other players want something super complicated like juggling 2 transformation types, charging phials with energy, combos with guard points (so you can block passively while comboing, if you can time it right), and slow moving attacks that hit for HUGE numbers.  There's even weapons for people who just want to learn timing and become invincible by blocking any incoming attack at exactly the right time (within milliseconds).  This game has something for everyone.\n\nI can't say enough, how pleased I am with this game.  I would have written this review before the game released on PC if I could have.  I have compared the PC version to the console versions and I have to say, it is GREAT.  Sure, they could have pushed the release back more than 8 months to polish up a few features that are less than perfect now... But, I would have played it in a super incomplete form 8 months ago if I could.  This game has so much to do... I don't have enough time in the week!\n\nAll that said, this game is not actually for everyone.  People who don't like challenging encounters, will find themselves up to their eyes in them, one after another throughout the whole game.  People who don't like working hard or repeating quests to attain self imposed goals... There's a lot of that in this game.  People who regard story so far above game play and combat mechanics that they would prefer a visual novel over dark souls.  This game is not for them.\n\nHowever, if you LOVE games that are super challenging (because that challenge is returned in rewardingness... I don't even think that's a word.  The game is sooo rewarding because it is so challenging).  If you love finding sub-systems that can help you to overcome a challenge OR if you prefer to brute force your way through a challenge with skills alone.  This game is for you.  If you like super deep crafting systems, where you need to collect hundreds of different types of materials to craft tiered items that continue to get better and better as you go.  If you love games where the combat is so well balanced that you can literally take any weapon of the same tier and know that it is balanced, yet completely different stats, statuses, and elements.  If you love games with options and open ended quest lines where you can do whatever you want, in order to obtain progress on the side while you take down this mountain of a monster.  THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.\n\nBig swords, fast swords, flying swords, shooting ranged swords.  Small monsters, medium monsters, giant monsters.  Character customization AND the ability to change your hair style/color, makeup style/color, armor color, mix and match sets for fashion or skills or defense...  did I mention SWORDS?!?\n\nThis game has it all.  \n\nMost of the people who are down voting this game either have not given it a fair shake, have a singular isolated issue, or are complaining about denuvo.  This game is top tier, apex tempered deviant and raging.\n\nI rate games on a buy, wait for sale, or never touch it rating system.  This game is an absolute MUST BUY.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44127867", "timestamp_created": 1534194094, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7457, "num_games_owned": 683, "playtime_forever": 22211, "steamid": "76561197998051494", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1534199544, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527031779289245605", "review": "All i wanted for 3 years now was a game that was monster hunter on pc.

Capcom failed to do both.\n\nWith 20 hours into the game, I can't say I've fully experienced all the goods and bads to be had, but the bads for me in these 20 hours is enough to warrant for a negative review. For me, there're 2 critical issues, and these 2 issues are disruptive enough to my gameplay that I can no longer enjoy myself by playing this game. I would request for a refund, but it's way too late for Steam's 2-hour playtime limit.\n\n1) [b]Game uses only CPU, not GPU (not all users); Capcom lacks clarification[/b] - First time launch with cutscenes would burn my i7-7700 up to 100%, while never using any GPU engines (GTX 1070). Frames would drop to 10fps, despite my setup far surpassing recommended specs. Task manager reveals (under high grahpics) uses 60%+ CPU constantly, while GPU never surpasses 0.1%. (It uses ~2GB VRAM, but none of the engines are used). CPU would spike periodically, causing my fan to go crazy/toggle between two fan speeds quickly. My worry is that it'll overheat my CPU/break my fan after prolonged usage. This has been reported numerous times, but no official response/clarifaction was made. Only response they (kinda) gave was along the lines of \"This game is made to be CPU heavy.\"\n\n2) [b]Disconnections (dc) and lack of fixes[/b] - A simple google search of \"mhw dc\" would yield tons of posts about the disconnection problems. For me personally, my Steam friends disconnects and reconnects periodically (~every 2 minutes), each time causing my game to freeze 0.2 seconds - enough to cause missed-dodges. Every freeze is a constant reminder of.... well, how [i]properly[/i] the devs are handling after-market issues. Many times, while I was just beginning to enjoy the gameplay, the game dc's, freezes, and causes me to miss a dodge/misplace for next strike (cucked for short). (Potential, unofficial) Solutions have been posted by many players, but no solution seems to work for everyone. It's been more than a week and no official statements nor fixes were released.\n\nEdit (Aug 22): Capcom posted on August 16 - one full week after the game was released, in the News section of their Steam Discussions about the dev team developing a fix to the dc issues. It is approaching two weeks from the release date, and still no fixes.

game for a bit longer i will have to say this might be the least enjoyable MH game ever. ive played around 200 hours in the original MH1, around 400 or more in Dos + Unite, Thousands of hours in MH Frontier, and maybe another 2500 hours with portable 3rd, MH4, MH4G, MHX, and MHXX.  \n\nive played the japanese versions of these games mostly because they released early despite not knowing a shred of japanese besides \"Arigato\"\n\nWhat monster hunter World adds to the franchise for graphics and shaders and textures and all that nice juicy stuff Most gamers seem to place too highly for quality products it lacks in almost every other field even to the original game from 2006.\n\nHitting monsters feels weak despite being the game where the Hunters are their strongest currently. Its far too easy to get an insane skillset, if you watch most speed run hunts on youtube most of them clear under 2 minutes. which is nearly half the time from games with \"G class\" which is the end game for monster hunter. Ice Borne will be the G class for this game. can the hunter possibly get any stronger?????\n\nWhy yes indeed they can because NOW they added slinger grappling hooks that allow you to forget about positioning and closing in on a monster and just latch onto it for free stuns. Monster Hunter used to be about patience, awareness, positioning. and sure all those things exist now but to a MUCH lesser extent. I was happy when hunting ARTS from mhXX werent making a return. But the stuff you can do in this game is even more insane. which just makes it NOT fun. Not only are the monsters much weaker than they have EVER been, the hunter like i said before is just so OVER powered. \n\nit makes the entire experience just a mashing frenzy. Of yeah yeah please die already. \n\nThe music is TERRIBLE, monster hunter has been known for its FANTASTIC soundtrack from every single game having great tracks to listen to. i mean just listen to \"Crimson Horn\" from MH1 or \"Red Afterglow Running in the Darkness\" and lets not forget \"Golden Reminiscence\" the music in town and on hunts is just cinematic GARBAGE with no care or love put into it. The Elder themes have also been butchered. \n\njust buy a nintendo switch and get Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate instead. its a superior product and actually worth more than its price. \n\ni will not be buying iceborne and i wish i could refund this casual shit show.\n\n\nEdit : i purchased iceborne KEK . still dont reccomend, fuck denuvo", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44128288", "timestamp_created": 1534195815, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579836787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4981, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 15415, "steamid": "76561197997193840", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1579749032, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "review": "It's a great game.\n\nPeople are mad about the PC port not being well optimized on release.\n\nCapcom is working on it, so that's cool.\n\nPlay with your friends to kill a bunch of mean suckers.\n\nTeam up with a cat person to get buffs or loot.\n\nPet a pig to earn his/her love and respect.\n\nIt's a great game.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44122558", "timestamp_created": 1534176293, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580126491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6446, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 39803, "steamid": "76561198321512270", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1535744177, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526598036289215088", "review": "Early game is trash, learn your prefered weapon, git gud, then blaze it in high rank, thats where the fun starts!\n\nconenction problems has been patched, graphics card incompatabilities exist (rip 1080) 1060 6gb works perfect", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "45209316", "timestamp_created": 1539205751, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580066792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10354, "num_games_owned": 319, "playtime_forever": 36612, "steamid": "76561198026615824", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1539205751, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526542305946350098", "review": "Please fixed the connection problem when play multiplayer.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44100593", "timestamp_created": 1534094860, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1545846031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 18664, "steamid": "76561198064234295", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1534094860, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526542305946350098", "review": "Y i k e s", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44100542", "timestamp_created": 1534094677, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1534094310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198153857171", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1534094677, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526542305946350098", "review": "Fix the meowtherfurking game.\n\nEdit:\nI thought this game just had server issues but upon trying the -nofriendsui fix people have discussed in the forums my save was corrupt on launching the game. \nThis is a great game but there is no way in hell I can recommend this to anyone after that.\n\nEdit 2:\nI played through this entire game again in an effort to remake my character and enjoy this game for what it is despite how shitty the port was but my save was corrupted TWICE. \n\"Failed to join quest.\" So you think you can quit out and save and try to make a fresh online session?

I've played the monster hunter games since monster hunter 4 ultimate and might I just say if you ever wanted to get into the monster hunter (MH) franchise, this is the perfect game for it. They've added a variety of little details  and quality of life changes since the DS games that make the game so easy to pick up- even the interface and overall \"starting\" parts are user and newbie friendly.\n\nGameplay wise, it's quite grindy- infact no, it's VERY grindy. There's quite a bit of repetitive gameplay when it comes to fighting monsters... as much as this can be seen as a con, this is very much a pro for the franchise. The main premise is to understand a monster's attack patterns and the more you play the game and fight said monster the better and more experienced you get! It's very satisfying to fight a monster that utterly destroys you one time only to fight it again and beat it with multiple \"predictions\" on attacks. As well as that, there are 14 different weapon types with a variety of different playstyles, such as the ranged weapons of bow and bowguns , the fast attackers like dual blads and sword 'n' shield and even the heavy hitters like hammer and great sword. In a game like this, there truly is no \"best weapon\" you simply pick one (or few) of the weapons you really do enjoy playing and kick ass with it. (Or get creamed,)\n\nI've played the ps4 version of the game also, I was excited to see what the mouse controls were like for the game only to be disappointed- they were extremely clunky and awkward... maybe it was my pc or the game, who knows? My friend also had the same problem; we both eventually decided to go  to using our controllers to play the game as it seemed to run much smoother and less complicated that way.\n\nOverall, it's just a fantastic game to play- an even better game to play with friends as it can have many moments that can lead to just a bunch of laughs even when you'd least expect it!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44592960", "timestamp_created": 1536201429, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578941868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 14870, "steamid": "76561198114129127", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1536201429, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526412606239318848", "review": "If you like to grind, this is the best game that you can have :)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54567934", "timestamp_created": 1565534388, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1568062701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 360, "playtime_forever": 4767, "steamid": "76561197993501875", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1565534388, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526399314403533936", "review": "my problem is because im using a DS4 controller.It has the interface of a xbox controller \nCan anyone help me with this problem.\noverall the game is excellent", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44037122", "timestamp_created": 1533884750, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580103794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3937, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 32869, "steamid": "76561198071547325", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1533884750, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52632606029510498", "review": "\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064  Crapcom Gib G-Rank \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45417117", "timestamp_created": 1540379538, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579875568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1143, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_forever": 17369, "steamid": "76561198004116389", "num_reviews": 74}, "timestamp_updated": 1540379538, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "review": "yes.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "60343717", "timestamp_created": 1577047618, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580061129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 921, "num_games_owned": 250, "playtime_forever": 18624, "steamid": "76561198042598902", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1577047618, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "review": "-play with a controller\n-maps look cool\n-the weapons look boring (such lazy)\n-play it with friends or it will get boring\n-overall the game is cool", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "47757745", "timestamp_created": 1545596714, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1576843150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 6518, "steamid": "76561198134621894", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1545596714, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "review": "this game is monsters", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44458770", "timestamp_created": 1535611521, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1573925646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 229, "playtime_forever": 5371, "steamid": "76561197982932998", "num_reviews": 194}, "timestamp_updated": 1535611521, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "review": "Update: Won Best Role Playing Game of the Year award, nominated for game of the year.\n\nNo, your $300 pc wont run it well.\n\nNever had Error 12 issues, using AMD card.

It's for a special kind of gamer - not everyone. \nI've developed a small test everyone can take to see if MHW is the game for them.\nWatch this short (30s) clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drg3jFix-nM \nIf you think this looks like a fun game, buy MHW.\n\nI'm not going to bring up the connectivity or performance issues again; there is literally hundreds of reviews complaining about those. They didn't affect me terribly, and I believe they will be fixed in due time.\n\nI'd prefer to focus on the actual game design issues this game has.\n\n1) Who's the audience?\nBeing a Dark-Souls'esque game, you'd think the audience is a pretty hardcore crowd of players. Why exactly does EVERY GOD DAMN THING EVER come with a tutorial then? Did anyone even read any of those? Who needs a tutorial for the shop? \nI don't get it. If your audience is hardcore players let them figure it out themselves. They're not idiots.\n\n2) Difficulty curve? More like difficulty stairs.\nAt some point the game decides it's simply done with the difficulty scaling it has been doing for the past 35 hours or so and instead hands every monster a oneshot ability. It's frankly awful game design and doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. \nIf you're looking for the infamous community-destroying example look up Behemoth.\nIt appears as if Capcom just couldn't make more difficult encounters without pushing them into the unfair. That just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, especially since the reward and game-over mechanics are tied to how often you got knocked out.\n\n3) What is this UI and who can I blame for it?\nThere are two different item menus constantly on your UI. Both are awful. The stash is awful (Yeah, as in \"the storage box\"). The quest selection menu is awful. The online play menu is awful. Selling equipped items opens Yes/No prompts with different pre-selections on whether you are sure and whether you want to sell. There is so many of these small issues that the UI overall can be considered a mess. \nScrewing up the stash is really something though. \n\n4) There is no hitbox, only screw attack\nThis is an issue that starts about the same time oneshots become an issue. The bosses stop swinging at you, but instead just turn into full-body hitboxes. \nThe monter is charging away from you while you're standing behind it? Doesn't matter, full damage for you.\nThe monster's wing gently brushed your cheek during a tail swipe? Full damage for you.\nYou were within 3 miles of the monster beginning to charge forward? Full damage for you.\n\nThis is a recurring theme. Anything that remotely looks like a dragon or t-rex does this. The few times the monster actually attempts to hit you instead of turning into a full-body-death-zone  you'll be surprised about how little damage that seemingly devastating stomp or claw-swipe did. And then it will just run you over without physically touching you for your full health bar.

I have been waiting since the console release for the PC release, and damn I was not disappointed. I didn't check any streams/reviews/spoilers and jumped straight to it at DAY 1. The servers were working only 2/3 of the time, but I played mostly solo in the beginning so I didn't really mind. The first two quests were pretty silly, I didn't pay much attention since they were irrelevant. But then the game starts to progress fast! Around the [spoiler] Anjanath [/spoiler] mission, my friends hopped in, and damn doing this thing with three semi-geared people is pretty tough! I was so fascinated with all the kinds of armour and weapons the game has to offer! Every time I slayed a new monster, I returned back to the blacksmith to see what kind of new EPIC gear I can make out of it.\n  That was mostly the hype I already had for it, but even after 50-60 hours, the game was still so attractive. \n\n  Everything has a progression which is really interesting! Damn even the stupidest thing, like the Canteen that you eat from can be upgraded! Side quests are interesting and fun to do... most of them! Some are just to gather stuff around the map, others to slay some specific monster, just what sidequests are supposed to be!\n\n  Now... I won't lie. If you want to play Monster Hunter, be prepeared. You need to farm the shit out of it. You have to kill monsters multiple times in order to create weapons and armors from them, which is pretty reasonable in my opinion. If I had to kill every monster once or twice and be done with it, it'd be pretty damn stupid. \n\n  The main story took me around 80-90 hours without trying to rush it.\n \n  Would I love for it to have more or even endless monsters to kill? Sure! Looking forward to the DLCs if there are any!\n\n--Cons--\n \n  I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT ONE B***H THAT IS YOUR \"PARTNER\" IS THE WORST NPC IN ANY GAME THERE IS. SHE'S DUMB, ANNOYING, USELESS AND UTTERLY IRRITATING. I WAS STUCK IN ONE QUEST AND EVERY TIME I LOST AND RETURNED TO BASE, I HEARD HER GOD DAMN VOICE. I HAD TO MUTE THE \"VOICE\" FROM THE ENTIRE GAME JUST SO I COULD BE SET FREE FROM HER. SHE'S THE DEVIL AND CURSE WHOEVER CREATED HER. F*** THE HANDLER. F*** THAT. IF SOMEONE CLAIMS THAT SHE IS THAT BAD, THE THE WHOLE GAME IS BAD BECAUSE OF HER, I WILL SUPPORT HIM.\n\nSince we're done with that, let's move to other, less important cons. Many people are complaining about certain things and I plan on adressing most of them:\n\n1. Graphics:\n  The graphics are not the best, but they sure are solid. This game has GAMEPLAY > GRAPHICS, which in my case didn't bother me at all. Please stop being obsessed with the realistic pristine graphics standard, it some times does not matter.\n\n2. The delayed release:\n  Guys, you knew it was delayed, Capcom said that they did not intend to release the game on PC and didn't want to release a rushed version but also not delay it too much since they are doing it anyway. Leaving a negative review and saying \"the game was delayed for 6 months\" is absolutely moronic.\n\n3. Keyboard/Mounse Issues:\n  The game is meant to be played with a gamepad (aka xBox controller, ps4 controller etc), just like Dark Souls or Rocket League or so many other pc games... the controls are not simplified just so mouse/keyboard users can have it easy. So if you don't like that, don't buy the game to begin with. You KNEW that a gamepad is recommended, if you ignore that don't come back whining.\n\n~TL;DR~\nThe game is amazing if you know what you're about to play. Most bad critics imo are from players who didn't know what they're buying.

Granted it's got a fresh coat of paint and so many QoL changes especially(but not only) outside of in-quest gameplay that the game feels like it underwent like a decade of franchise evolution over the course of a single game(which makes sense, the handheld games, while a lot of fun, never really elevated themselves above PS2-esque style and mechanics for a variety of reasons), but the core does appear to be intact, with all its strengths and weaknesses, to my relief. When I first saw the game's previews I was scared that they'd tamper with it too much. They did tamper with it a little, but I feel like most of the additions make sense and integrate themselves well into the game overall, even if I don't agree with a few oversimplifcations here and there.\n\nThere's many things to like about this game, it looks really pretty even on lower graphical settings, the moveset additions for each weapon I've seen make sense and are fun(especially as someone that plays Gunlance religiously, so much cool useful stuff was added, the weapon finally doesn't feel garbo and weak anymore!), I actually quite like the hunting sling thingamajig they gave everyone, and it's obviously still Monster Hunter so the gameplay loop, while simple in theory and slightly awkward and initially overwhelming in practice, is extremely solid, nigh-infinitely replayable(due to the meticulously designed creatures) and quite addicting. I think what I like above all though is the focus on the playing field itself in this game. Movement feels fluid and thoroughly entertaining even just running around gathering stuff and looking out for the next big game to slap your impractically sized weapon into with extremely vertical and interconnected design of the fairly open levels, and between the little things like how you can use vines and wedge beetles to get around quicker, using environmental hazards such as poisonous plants, elemental frog fellas or thick undergrowth to subdue and weaken monsters and the improvisation-focused nature of how the slinger and most of its ammo works there's a real focus on getting to know the locale and learning how to best make use of your nearby surroundings, which combined with the open, sprawling terrains makes the fights seem a lot scrappier and more like an actual hunt/chase than just a typical boss fight that occassionally runs away to change the shape of the arena.\n\nIT'SA MODERN MASTAH PEECE.\n\n... well, or it WOULD be, if the PC port wasn't so lousy. It isn't UNPLAYABLE, we're not talking Dark Souls 1-tier of awful here, but it's notoriously poorly optimized, and the game starts to tank the framerate like a mother lover for a short time at seemingly entirely random in-game events, and doesn't run that well on highest graphics settings either way(mostly due to one or two particular graphics options being unreasonably performance-expensive for no real reason). Online used to be bad, so I heard, but I figure they fixed it by now, because I had very few issues. Still, easily drops this game from a 10/10 to a like 7/10 or so(and only because I like Monster Hunter enough that I'd probably play it no matter what).\n\nCome on, step up your game Capcom. I want to say that I have faith in them because I like most of their franchises, a felt half of Capcom PC ports are at least semi-decent and sometimes goddamn great and they want to support this game with DLC so fixing the worst of it would be in their best interests, but trusting in that company is always such a coinflip.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44675766", "timestamp_created": 1536624923, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579994518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 13460, "steamid": "76561198066149795", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1537122156, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "review": "A very good game, that keep the quality of the monster hunter franchise and manage to get better and more dynamic\n\nBUT Servers are still in bad state but its getting better very slowly, you can play the game with friends without too much problem ( in eu at least)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44460248", "timestamp_created": 1535617765, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579946057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 23785, "steamid": "76561198063514954", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1535617765, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "review": "After much waiting, backhanded comments from Console players, unfounded claims that Capcom would not deliver a proper port and the whining masses review bombing the game because they have potatoes and/or experienced connection issues (which were more on Steam's side than Capcom's) which are now FIXED, I am going to review this game.\n\nIT IS AMAZING! Period.\n\nThe game offers a wonderfully engaging gameplay loop with many different monsters to hunt, providing a variety of experiences that a Monster Hunter title should have.\n\nSporting a roster of 14 weapon types, there's something for everyone. From the speedy dual swords to the powerhouse greatsword, you can do anything if you're willing to take the time to learn your weapon's intricacies and master positioning. It takes time, of course, but with MHW, time is not an issue. The only limited thing in the game are the time-sensitive events, that are around for a short while before being switched up for a new set of event quests.\n\nLike exploring? Welcome to the EXTREMELY open zones of Monster Hunter: World. When on an expedition for research, or hunting a specific monster, there are no loading screens out in the selected zones. The sprawling landscapes are home to several ecosystems and a staggering number of creatures. Without giving too much away, all I can really say is that the zones are massive.\n\nMy favourite thing this time around would have to be the Monster Turf Wars. There's nothing quite as satisfying as watching two huge creatures duke it out over territory. The engagements are vicious, and often end with one monster SORELY regretting its decision to pick a fight with whichever other monster whose territory it waltzed into.\n\nBetween the combat mechanics, the vast array of creatures and the ability to customize your setup to suit your weapon and playstyle, Monster Hunter: World presents you with the opportunity to feel like a badass in your own right.\n\n[b]NOTE[/b]\nWhen other people tell you that MHW is the \"easiest\" title in the series because they solo'ed the \"story\", pay them no mind. Yes, you finished the \"single player\" aspect of the game. Now, go on and try your hand at the new challenges and then tell me just how \"easy\" it is. If your reasoning is that MH: Generations on the Switch will be harder because \"insert vague reason here\", remember that they actively made this title more ACCESSIBLE to new players, not easier. There's a big difference between dumbing the game down and allowing newer players to the series to ease themselves into the difficulty curve. And dumb it down they have not.\n\n[b][u]OVERVIEW:[/u][/b]\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b]\n9/10 - Sure the game's a little demanding, but it is BEAUTIFUL and no one can say otherwise.\n\n[b]AUDIO[/b]\n9/10 - Between monster roars, battle music and the sound of weapons cleaving through flesh, the game's got GREAT audio.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n10/10 - Easily the best gameplay of the MH series so far. So much to do, many ways to approach a situation and visceral combat make this a fantastic title.\n\n[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]\n10/10 - They got this just right. Preparation and knowledge are half the battle. With the new \"internal monster wiki\" at your disposal, you can set yourself up for success ahead of time and go into a fight prepared for the worst situations! However, the monsters are not slouches. Even if you've brought everything to make a monster's life a living hell, it can also return the favour tenfold. Never underestimate any of these creatures, as they will chew you up and spit you out without the slightest hesitation.\n\n[b]CONTROLS[/b]\n9/10 - The controls are fluid. Be it mouse and keyboard, or gamepad. Your attacks flow together seamlessly and dodging feels responsive. Knowing when to use your big attacks that lock you into animations is the biggest obstacle, but once you figure it out, you'll be pretty good!\n\n[b]CONTENT[/b]\n9/10 (for now) - There's a lot there, even after you \"finish\" the main story of the game. With a massive amount of content coming (FOR FREE I might add), the game's content rating will easily jump to a 10/10 for me.\n\n[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]\n9.3/10 - With this game being the way it is, after Capcom has rectified the majority of connection issues, it deserves to stand as a titan of a game. It is, without a doubt, the best Monster Hunter I have ever played. And I have played all of them up until 4 Ultimate (I skipped that one onward until MH:W released on PC).\n\n[b]STATUS[/b]\n[i]GAME OF THE YEAR[/i]\n\nBravo Capcom, bravo.\n\nI can wholeheartedly say that I recommend this game.

I joined the series back in 3 Ultimate on the Wii U and was hooked, 4 Ultimate shortly followed and I dumped over 1000 hours into it. I used to think that 4 Ultimate was the pinnacle of the series, it was my absolute favourite. Then this game came along.\n\nMy best advice to you, a newcomer or veteran, worried about the mixed reviews? Ignore them. Most are people complaining about things that have either been fixed or don't ruin the game as a whole. Trust me, I was in your shoes and was ready to refund when installing out of worry, damn am I happy that I was wrong.\n\n[u]Pros.[/u]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Smooth, fluid gameplay.\n    [*]Weapons have depth, with each feeling different enough from each other to increase replayability tenfold.\n    [*]There are no bad weapons, despite what people will tell you. Each one is as viable as the others.\n    [*]Stays true to the roots of Monster Hunter, whilst refining the kinks and smoothing gameplay.\n    [*]Very rewarding, you feel accomplished when struggling with a monster but learning and preparing only to crush them.\n    [*]Free content DLC! The only paid DLCs are strictly cosmetic.\n    [*]Amazingly optimized. It runs consistently at 60fps on low graphics on my crappy PC, I was honestly surprised.\n    [*]I genuinely felt interested in uncovering the reasons behind the happenings with the enviroments and monsters, especially in high rank.\n    [*]Huge amounts of quality of life changes (for the better mind you, don't listen to the complaints of \"casualization\". They're wrong). So many that I'd rather not list them here.\n    [*]I was surprised to find that the game feels great on a keyboard and mouse! I haven't picked up a controller for it since the early game.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons.[/u]\n\n[list]\n    [*]No option to turn motion blur off, thankfully the motion blur isn't near as bad as most games.\n    [*]Menus can be complicated for beginners, with the multiplayer menus being hard to understand even for some veterans of monhun.\n    [*]The Handler. I never thought I could hate a character in a Monhun game as much as her, but oof.\n    [*]Story isn't anything to write home about, as per usual with Monhun games, it's the gameplay that's focused.\n    [*]Less content than most Monhun games, due to there not being a G rank. Content updates are a thing though.\n    [*]Monster designs are less varied than most Monhun games, with World focusing on lizards, wyverns and the like, most with similar body structure.\n[/list]\n\nDo yourself a favour and save up to buy this absolute masterpiece at full price.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44443284", "timestamp_created": 1535547904, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1569194064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 23404, "steamid": "76561198099766589", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1535547938, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525043129920959473", "review": "This game is amazing and worth the price, the controls take some getting used too, and network connection can be a problem at times (tho I have good connection 99% of the time).", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44231913", "timestamp_created": 1534605285, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580013358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5577, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 40344, "steamid": "76561198038856011", "num_reviews": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1534605285, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525013446807861328", "review": "10/10 Best game on steam.

After years of hoping MH Frontier would make it to the US so I could actually have it on PC, having played Toukiden Kiwami as a mediocre substitute, and give Dauntless a (rather short) try, it's finally happened - a PC Monster Hunter game in the US.\n\nIf you've played Monster Hunter before, this game will feel very familiar to you (happily, without the 3DS touch screen camera control).  That goes for the good things - fun monsters, fun weapons, playing with friends (assuming the latest patch holds up), and feeling powerful while also feeling like what you're fighting is more powerful.  And also the negative things - the occasional weird hitbox, especially on those hip checks and, ffs, if the monster is doing one of those weird charge into the ground attacks, just stay away from it's rear end until it stops.\n\nA gameplay note - this game has been on console for the past 14 years.  As such, expect it to just play better with a controller.  Some games are like this.  The team seems to be taking recommendations on improving KB&M controls, but, like Dark Souls, I would personally always play this with a controller.  If you go into it expecting it to be 100% KB&M optimized, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nIf you're new to the franchise, don't expect it to be Dauntless levels of difficulty - you will get wrecked.  A lot, most likely, while learning the game.  If you take the time to learn the game, understand the flow of combat, and learn your weapon(s), I think you'll really enjoy this new iteration of Monster Hunter.\n\nAt release, this game was *plagued* with connection issues.  This is, sadly, not an unusual thing with big releases lately, but a bit of patience has really paid off - as of yesterday they released a patch that seems to have fixed my groups entire connection issue roster, so we'll see if that continues.\n\nAlso, it should be noted - this game is VERY intense on your CPU, so if your PC is older, expect this game to let you know how much older.  I do hope they optimize this a bit, but if they don't, I guess we have the new Crysis - 2018's benchmarking game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, especially now that the connection issues have been cleared up.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44341751", "timestamp_created": 1535073887, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580114336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6060, "num_games_owned": 454, "playtime_forever": 25051, "steamid": "76561198000721268", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1535074148, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524871766567230225", "review": "MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD ICEBORNE\n\nCAPCOM's x-pansion grindfest has arrived for PC and its a alot of awsome new additions but its sadly bogged down by performance issues like stutters, memeory leaks, Dx device crashes, audio desync or no audio at all, freezing, framerate issues and the cherry on top is the mindboggeling high cpu load curtesy of the new anticheat cheking the game constantly making it crash or hardlock itself.\n\nThe GOOD\n\nWonderfull monster and world design.\nUpdated graphics makes the game look better then ever when it works.\nA bombastic and heroic OST during intense encounters.\nWeapon variety is fantastic and affects gameplay in diffrent ways.\nArch-Tempered monsters.\n\nThe BAD\n\nVolumetric rendering >> set this to off in the options menu <<\nConnection error's once in a while.\nPoor launch performance with various buggs and issues across the board for all players.\nThe anticheat cause cpu usage way above what it should be >>being looked at by devs<<\n\nI need more MH:W ICEBORNE in my life so fix your game CAPCOM!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44030366", "timestamp_created": 1533856704, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580132439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2889, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 23535, "steamid": "76561198355267271", "num_reviews": 66}, "timestamp_updated": 1579612689, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52486187219619751", "review": "Now that the network works, all there is left is a really fun game.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44556496", "timestamp_created": 1536008027, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1561910018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 229, "playtime_forever": 7459, "steamid": "76561198052163192", "num_reviews": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1536008027, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52486187219619751", "review": "Stop reading the idiots posting negative reviews.

I hope I won't run into more issues, however so far the port is pretty good!\n\nEDIT: You can actually switch to keyboard item select mode, not sure how to use it yet but it appears to be a simple 1-8 hotkey bar, so it seems that problem is mainly caused by the game not automatically switching between keyboard/gamepad quick switch layouts (If it did, it would probably cause some compatibility issues, so I'm not going to call this a negative point by any means)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44027164", "timestamp_created": 1533846122, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1550088601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 449, "playtime_forever": 1250, "steamid": "76561198042251944", "num_reviews": 19}, "timestamp_updated": 1533923244, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523891627788543701", "review": "This is the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played and if you happen to be a fan of the Dark Souls series or Dragon's Dogma, then this game is for you. Like the games mentioned, you also have the option to play solo or bring friends. It's extremely fun to just venture out into the elaborate maps of MHW in a way that each hunt is just as thrilling if not more thrilling than the previous. The gameplay gets repetitive from time to time, but the combat and the smallest of details that you'll see in the game compensates for it. \n\nThat aside, this PC port is not without flaws. I'd say it's a below average port due to how it seems to be inferior compared to the PS4 and Xbox One versions despite the hardware capabilities of a PC. In terms of content, PC is just behind and while it's kind of understandable. The event collaborations and other free updates that the console versions received needs to come to the PC version at a faster pace since there are people like me who are eating away this game and are somehow running out of things to do besides hunting for decorations and helping people progress. \n\nAnyway, there's a lot to see and learn each time you come back to this game so it's definitely worth the purchase and hence despite having to turn down some settings, I still decided to recommend this game through this review. Seeing all the negative reviews, I hope the developers in charge of the game are not discouraged to release future Monster Hunter titles to the PC.

Graphically, the game designers did a great job at making the environments, every single detail being accounted for makes for a beautiful immersive surrounding. It's easy to just look at the sun set in the Ancient Forest, or watch the waterfalls in the Wildspire Waste. However, the environments pale in comparison to the gargantuan dragonkin that you're going to be facing off against.  Gameplay wise, the combat is engaging and rewarding, it pays off to be patient, and learn the monster's behaviors before going aggressive on your openings. Each weapon feels unique, and that gives a unique perspective of the game; using a large blunt weapon like a hammer, requires a drastically different playstyle, that using a long range weapon like a bow. On the other hand, the gameplay loop can get stale, no matter how diverse the weapon roster is, so it's up to you to enjoy the crafting progression, and set goals for yourself. Story wise, the game could be better, although it has vague approach to storytelling, the funny looking cast of characters contrasts against the severity that is a massive elder dragon threatening to disrupt the natural balance. The game contains a very loose, but clear message of being cognizant of the environment, and how everything is linked through the natural order from the lowliest herbivore to the massive apex wyverns that make home in this universe. \n\nOverall, I rate this game highly\nGraphics: 4/5\nGameplay: 5/5 (or 4/5 if you don't enjoy the crafting aspect of it)\nStory: 2/5", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62434895", "timestamp_created": 1580028420, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580080044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5232, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 9665, "steamid": "76561198062708186", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1580028420, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "its pretty neat", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62432286", "timestamp_created": 1580024712, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580106115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4382, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 49231, "steamid": "76561198086430977", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1580024712, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "hunt monsters in a world", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62411448", "timestamp_created": 1579991825, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580102926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2218, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 13004, "steamid": "76561198242357570", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1579991825, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "fun\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62408853", "timestamp_created": 1579988480, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580084446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 3178, "steamid": "76561198074426969", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1579988480, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Games pretty dope, but it throws too much at you at the begining making you want to refund it instantly. if you stick through the first 4 hours which are basically a tutorial youll enjoy it alot.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62405879", "timestamp_created": 1579984822, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580114336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4347, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 8667, "steamid": "76561198064776788", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1579984822, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Good game", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62401164", "timestamp_created": 1579979373, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580042359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 399, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 755, "steamid": "76561198246076484", "num_reviews": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1579979373, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Maximum comf included in Iceborne.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "62391646", "timestamp_created": 1579969019, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580073395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4140, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 39567, "steamid": "76561198066546074", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1579969019, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Damn good game.

The base game is a special experience especially if you have never seen these monsters before or if this is your first monster hunter game, like me. The turf wars between monsters is always exhilarating, and it gives a breath of life to the monsters and their environment.\nIceborne is a great improvement and merely calling it a dlc feels like a disservice considering it feels like a whole new monster hunter game with how much was added. Iceborne to me really drives in the point that there is always a bigger fish. It is deceptive how much content there is to cover and once you finish one story plotline, something else will come up and there will be an even greater threat to the area that you must hunt. For instance, as of writing this review, I have finished what I thought would have been the final monster hunt/final quest only to be sucker punched by a \u2018seething bazelgeuse\u2019.

I will change this review if Capcom decides to at least fix the CPU Performance issue. Otherwise my issue with the game stands.\n==============================================\n[h2] EDIT: UPDATE CPU PATCH 2020/01/27 GAME CRASHES [/h2]\nCapcom has removed the hard coded CRC checks in favor of implementing anti-tamper code that causes the game to crash. It is the same code that garnered Monster Hunter World mixed reviews when it first released on Steam. Check out Kaldaein's thread on why this is a problem. I would not buy this game yet. To be honest, I would be vary wary of buying this game at all knowing that Capcom likes to delay fixes and swap already broken code in and out of their executables. They might fix this game next week but decide to break it again the week after. Your CPU's health is much more important than a single game you need to purchase.\n==============================================\n[h2] EDIT: UPDATE CPU PATCH HOTFIX BROKEN [/h2]\nCapcom has recently patched the game on 2020/01/17 to address the CPU problems. However they have simply limited the amount of CPU usage of whatever code it is that they have implemented. If you have a borderline passable CPU then you will not feel the effect of this \"hotfix\". It is still extremely irregular to have a game use 70% of all threads on a Ryzen 2600 nor should it trigger scans from 2 of my Anti-Viruses. I'm sorry Capcom but I still trust my anti-virus more than I trust your proprietary code.\n\n(Original Review below)\n==============================================\n[h2] 100% CPU Usage will break your computer [/h2]\nI cannot recommend this game at this state. The BASE GAME suffers from terrible performance due to malicious code patched into the game. If you are barely within the minimum specs of the game, you will no longer be able to play it after the recent patch! AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PLAY, YOUR CPU MAY OVERHEAT AND BREAK.\n\nI am running this game on a Ryzen 2600, and this patch changed my CPU usage from 50% (pre-patch) to 95% (Iceborne Patch). If I set the affinity of the game to only use 4 of my 12 available CPU threads, then those 4 threads go 100% and game performance does not change (deteriorate) at all. \n\nThis leads me to believe that there is something about this patch that forces your CPU to use more processing than necessary. I'm hearing about CRC checks that implement ANTI-CHEATS and ANTI-MODS being patched into the game which is something I do not understand for a full priced CO-OP game. Unsurprisingly, modders and pirates have already bypassed this problem and are playing the game at full performance.\n==============================================\n[h2] Wasted Harddisk Space [/h2]\nFINALLY: If you bought this game at it's initial recommended spec, you will notice that the game only requires 30GB Harddisk space. The game itself only took around 20.7GB but AFTER THE DLC PATCH, THE GAME NOW REQUIRES 41GB OF HARD DISK SPACE.\n\nThis is unacceptable especially if you do not own ICEBORNE, that is an extra 20.3GB of content that you will not be consuming, sitting on your hard drive. CAPCOM is able to set HD Textures as a separate DLC branch, they SHOULD be able to implement ICEBORNE as a separate downloadable DLC branch as well.", "voted_up": false, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "61673905", "timestamp_created": 1578738841, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580093922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "num_games_owned": 552, "playtime_forever": 1546, "steamid": "76561197988536779", "num_reviews": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1580096905, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "kill monster very good", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "61665953", "timestamp_created": 1578725636, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580115229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4489, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 20493, "steamid": "76561197968275774", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1578725636, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 2, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Make Yukumo Layered Armor as a free DLC pls.

World is my first entry to this series, although I have heard of monster hunter before when I was a kid, at the time I always assumed it's some sort of Pokemon rip off for adults but boy I'm absolutely wrong. \n\n***The Good part of this game:***\n\nThis game is hard, like really hard, and its made worse since I know nothing about monster hunter at the time. So I constantly google  what the \"best\" weapon is to use, and how to make mega potions etc. \n\n1. Monster hunter world is also a very grindy game, but the journey of constantly polishing your skill with a weapon and grinding for materials perfectly compensates each other, and that is the core of monster hunter world.\n\n2. This game is visually stunning, with vibrant areas to explore and its interactions with its wild life. \n\n3. Lots of weapon choices offered at the very start, each with a different learning curve and play style. This is the best part about this game(I main Switch axe).\n\n4. Different monsters interact with other monsters and the environment in different ways, offering dynamic ways of fighting them that is slightly different each time.\n\n***The slightly annoying stuff of this game***\n\nMonster Hunter World however is not perfect, and I don't know if I'm being fussy but:\n\n1. What is the point of having a canteen in the Main Hub if its in a completely different area than the one the player spawns in each time returning home, nobody is going to go through a loading screen to get there when they can just do it in an expedition.\n\n2. The quest difficulty discourages 2-3 player groups since any number of player more than 1 will set the difficulty to be the same as a 4 player group.\n\n3. The end game grind is kinda linear, meaning that there aren't much to grind for except the augmentation stones. Materials for gears and weapon are given to you in heaps so you don't really need to grind for it.\n\n4. This is a controversial one, but I find some of the Arch Tempered monsters incredibly unfair and frustrating to fight. Monsters like AT Lunastra and AT Nergigante are especially tiring to fight since it requires the player to have the reaction time of a god to dodge some of their attacks.\n\nMost of the problems mentioned are mainly endgame issues, the main story line is actually pretty fair and balanced.\n\nThat been said , can't wait for Iceborne!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54116811", "timestamp_created": 1563218972, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580137408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2710, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 27687, "steamid": "76561198043414701", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1563663120, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "When Behemoth was actually the real deal more than any other monsters.\n\nThen it starts to screaming and summoning a giant meteor............\n\nGuess I'll die.\n\nedit : I'll take that back, so Nergigante was the hardest, Kirin for 2nd, and Behemoth for the 3rd.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54112905", "timestamp_created": 1563203738, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575716492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 9457, "steamid": "76561198163988212", "num_reviews": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1565396355, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "I like hitting the monsters, but i dont like it when the monster hits me", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "54101445", "timestamp_created": 1563143560, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580136671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4939, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 110377, "steamid": "76561198096856734", "num_reviews": 152}, "timestamp_updated": 1563143560, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Animal Cruelty/10", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54092026", "timestamp_created": 1563107740, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580135099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1063, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 6762, "steamid": "76561198080460090", "num_reviews": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1563107740, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "GREAT CONTENT\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54087073", "timestamp_created": 1563086314, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1564835896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 800, "steamid": "76561198113627357", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1563086314, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Best game since childhood :)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "54068538", "timestamp_created": 1563004997, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1565860368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 9566, "steamid": "76561198134510625", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1563004997, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "hit big dogs", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "54063771", "timestamp_created": 1562978691, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580099487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3477, "num_games_owned": 139, "playtime_forever": 21008, "steamid": "76561198027895568", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1562978691, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "My first time playing Monster Hunter was Lost Planet.

Its makes you think more about where your placing your attacks and what weapon you will be bringing, as well as learning when and where to block or dodge.\n- Weapons large variety of weapons with cool attacks. There will probably be at least one weapon you love. While some of the weapons look meh at low rarities, at rarity 7 and above they start looking awesome if they dont already.\n- Capturing monsters gives you more loot, so if you break and sever all the parts and capture it, its more effient than purely killing everything, also reduces some of the grind.\n- SOS, while I am a solo player. Trying to leave out spoilers but: The monster you face in the Collossal Task quest is easy but there are breakable hidden in plain sight parts that will increase the drop chance of the rarest drop from that monster. Firing an SOS really helps get that item for when your farming the monster and the SOS flare gets a lot of attention fast.\n- Turf Wars, its awesome to see the large monsters fighting for territory and as long as they dont both target you, it can work out in your favour.\n- Mounting, fun, looks badass and knocks the monster down if you dont get thrown off. \n(You have to do a certain amount of damage before you can mount again, worth knowing if you play with an Insect Glaive)\n- No fall damage, hitchin a rides on wind drakes, mantels that lets you glide or do other stuff is fun\n\nThere are a few cons:\n- Handler/NPC Partner (She's funny how she gets into trouble but a lot of players think shes annoying)\n- Combat is tougher with others which can be a con for using an sos flare and the money/Zenny is divided between players, also if someone faints it reduces the overall money so if you need more coins. (Although when your at a certain lvl there are easy quests/bounties that do give a lot of zenny. One about killing Coral highland Shamos and one about getting fossils from the place you unlock after the Coral Highlands.)\n- If someone gets knocked out the whole team pays for it. If you play with others and someone on your team isnt doing well and keeps going down the team will fail the mission which is a bit harsh, especially when helping lower lvls or if someone hasnt really played against that monster much.\n\n\nThings to note:\n- I've spent countless hours on the PS4 but only just started playing on PC, the PS4 controller works completely fine on the PC Steam version but the control prompts are Xbox. There is a Dual Shock mod on Nexus mods if any of you prefer a PS4 controller, no install, just replace a folder with the folder you get from Nexus. Also note that the share button is actually the touch pad symbol and the touch pad is the R3 button.\n- There aren't actually that many monsters, some monsters sub catagories of other monsters so basically a different colour and maybe a different or additional element. However, the tempered versions and events do give good rewards, plus if you want full sets of armour or fully upgrading your weapon it can be very grindy so you may be too busy to notice this until you reach the end game ranks. They do also add in more monsters every now and then, like in the Witcher event quest and the Final Fantasy Cross over. Heard there will be some Monsters from the previous games may be making an entrance at some point too so over time the not many monsters statement may slowly change over time.\n- If Poogie, the cute pig in Aestera that you can pet, dress and cuddle, is happy enough, it can find items for you around Astera if you put it on the floor when its bouncing in your arms. You can find all sorts around the tradeyard and somewhere there is a meal voucher if you want to eat for free ;)\n\nI brought the Deluxe version on the PS4 when it first came out and then recently got it on PC so definitley recommending this game.\n\n\nEdit: Removed Graphics con as they recently did a graphics update for PC which is awesome :)", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "48513778", "timestamp_created": 1548287120, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580088195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3746, "num_games_owned": 366, "playtime_forever": 24043, "steamid": "76561198242644934", "num_reviews": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1580089794, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Kill shit.

However, I rarely put the game down after it, and have currently sunk around 230 hours in the game. In my opinion, MHW is like all of the good things of Generations, with more size, more complexity (and yet is somewhat simpler too), far improved graphics, and a great world to explore. I've currently put less than 30 hours in world due to other games distracting me, but from what I've played of World, here's the short of the pros and cons:\nPros:\n- The graphics of the game are astonishing. Nothing much else to say, really. Vibrant worlds where important parts stick out, the monsters themselves are profoundly detailed and the effects on things like Anjanth's fire and Tobi-Kodaichi's electricity are amazing, and the world is, as a whole, beautiful.\n- The weapon combo system is fantastic. While not too much a departure from what i used in Generations, having the prompts in the upper-right part of the screen showing what combos you can do after each attack is a brilliant fix, so you no longer have to menu dive to find out how to do that one specific, really powerful move your weapon has.\n- The monster hunts are epic, dangerous, fast-paced, and interesting. During one story mission, a Rathalos came down while I was fighting the quest monster, and, me being terrified of such a beast at an early point in the game, ran away and watched. To my surprise, the Rathalos not only fought the other monster, but actually picked it up in its jaws, flew up, and body-slammed it into the ground, causing crazy-high damage. The fact that monsters have this kind of interaction with one another is an interesting and at times hilarious way to spice up a hunt.\n- So many other things that I can't list. Being early in the game, I've not experienced anywhere near everything the game has to offer. Heck, I've probably fought less than 10 different big monsters as of the date I'm writing this. But, if the game keeps on going as it is, I've no doubt I'll find more praises to sing.\n\nHowever, there are a few points of this game I'm not too fond of. While most are minor, there's one in particular that I'll highlight. To me, the multiplayer is a little bit off compared to how I envisioned it. In Generations, you found a hub, got there, and there were 1-3 other people there to hunt with you. This made it to where people ususally, at least in my experience, formed groups of 4 for hunts. In World, I have a hard time FINDING hubs with 3-4 other people. Maybe it's because I'm still early on, or I'm low HR, but it's a little frustrating at times. However, I have heard that Steam Groups replace the Squads that are found on the Xbox and PS4 versions of the game, so I'll be trying to find a group dedicated to hunting.\n\nAll in all, World completely lived up to its promises, in my opinion. Since it's very possible that my lack of multiplayer experiences are due to not being in a group that focuses on MHW, it could be my own fault that I'm not enjoying that aspect of the game as I did in Generations. If you liked the other entries in the series, or have wanted to get into MHW but didn't buy one of the older games, I highly recommend this game to you. If your machine can run it, and if you've got the time for it, it's not likely to be a purchase you'll regret making.

I've pretty much played all of the releases with the exception of missing one or two. This is by far my favorite one from capcom because they finally had the advantage of a powerful console to really improve the mechanics for the game. I hope they keep going in this direction with the game.\n\nI get why a lot of people are turned off from this game right away. The orginial game was built with clunky controls that made the game have a steep learning curve. But that was the fun to me and probably every other monster hunter fan. You loved the challenge of memorizing monster attacks and when to use an item (and go through the totally unneccesary flex pose leaving your self vulnerable). You worked around the clunky controls (which didnt seem so clunky after you mastered them) and felt the satisfaction of killing giant ass cool looking monsters with unique move sets. The entire series has pretty much followed the orginal game mechanics which is totally fine for me. I like the challenge because I enjoy fighting giant monsters more then getting upset about the controls and this game series is one of the few that feature killing giant monsters with cool weapons.\n\nSo the actual bad stuff I would say is:\n-Yes the cutscenes don't match the voices (who the hell cares, the games about killing giant monsters)\n-The story is kinda batshit crazy (Veteran hunter leader knows elder dragons cant be captured...........tries to capture huge ass elder dragon)\n-Everytime the handler speaks or does anything, I want to impale myself with a gunlance and pull the trigger....\n-There isnt much to do besides kill monsters and get better gear to kill more monsters (That part doesnt bother me, im just putting here because most people dont like that about the game.\n\n\nAll in all I love this game series and I love the latest direction they went with the game. I hope in time people will come to look past the one or two things wrong with the game and enjoy the game for what it is..

I strongly recommend the game. try it out and I seriously doubt you'd be dissapointed. the game is gorgeous, it feels wonderful and for those that are familiar with the MH series you should definitely give it a shot if you haven't already. \n\n\nComing from a MH background I am familiar with the game's mechanics and nuances and Monster Hunter World has made SO many Quality of Life changes that it is mind boggling. While I will say that many of these QoL changes have likely been done to make it easier for newcomers to the series I still feel they are very welcome and it has streamlined much of the clunky and time consuming aspects that many of us \u201cveterans\u201d would be used to. \n\nGameplay wise and at its core it has still captured what makes Monster Hunter at it's core SO much fun and that is that the \u201cmonsters\u201d themselves. While likely seen as \u201cbosses\u201d to other games or those unfamiliar with the series they have still made all the monsters feel. \u201calive\u201d and not exactly enemies for the sake of being enemies. They are all part of an ecosystem something akin to Jurassic Park with some anime thrown in. Each weapon type are all simple to learn, hard to master. And the more time you spend playing the game the more you not only learn about the monsters you hunt but you become overall a better hunter and a master of your chosen weapon. If you use nothing but a specific weapon for an extended period of time then switch to something else it almost feels like a completely different game. Since each weapon has its own play-style, strengths and weaknesses. The best part of it all? ALL weapons are 100% viable to play through the whole game solo. Capcom have had a very long time ironing out all of the weapons over the years and I feel that the iteration of them all in MHW is one of the best 'version' of each weapon yet. They all feel great to use and a lot of fun.\n\nGraphically speaking the game is rather gorgeous. I wouldn't say it is the most \u201coptimised\u201d PC port to date but for the most part it is pretty solid. Still think there could be some more improvements to make the game smoother (and stop tanking frames at certain points/situations) but I've never had it to a point where the game became unplayable especially in such an action orientated title. \n\nContent wise I feel the game is pretty good. There is plenty to do, farm, acquire and obtain in your adventures and on its own I feel there is a good amount of content here. For Monster Hunter \u201cveterans\u201d however I feel you may be a bit... disappointed in the overall content. For those unfamiliar with monster hunter... this is what the game has and doesn\u2019t have in a nutshell:\n\nLow rank monsters: (yes) introduces most of the monsters. You could say low rank is the \u201ctutorial\u201d for the most part\n\nHigh rank monsters: (yes) this is where the majority of the games content is for the most part. You'll be fighting HR monsters for most of your playtime farming their materials, making armor, upgrading weapons etc. \n\nG-rank: (no...?) okay for those that don't know what G-rank is: this is basically the \u201cendgame\u201d of Monster Hunter. Here. The monsters are stronger than ever. They will even have expanded move sets. Completely new armor sets to obtain. New weapons/upgrades to get. \n\nHaving said that. MHW sort of...? has its own \u201cversion\u201d of it but for the most part... I think it sucks. In MHW you get \u201cTempered\u201d monsters. And at the end of the day the only real difference between HR and Tempered is that the Tempered monsters hit harder and are more likely to drop \u201cdecorations\u201d that you use to help give you a little/major edge when customising your armor and skillsets. \n\nThere is going to be \u201cArch-Tempered\u201d coming soon for those that have only been following the PC release of MHW since consoles already have it but really again. ONLY the Eldar Dragons have been \u201cArch Tempered\u201d they DO give a new armor set with some variations to the skills they provide outside of that there are MINOR visual differences and thats it. SOME of them have new moves (and really I think its Teostra and thats it) but outside of that... they just hit harder again.... and that\u2019s it... its the laziest form of \u201cG-rank\u201d I feel they could have done here.... and I feel they have seriously dropped the ball here....\n\nin the other Monster Hunter games. G-rank was a step up again... new armor sets with completely new visuals... aka Low/High rank Rathalos armor looks different to G-rank Rathalos etc and generally its not just some minor detail some armor sets are completely different to their normal counterparts which was SO cool imo.\n\nNot only that but the other Monster hunter titles have so many more monsters in its roster...\nMHW has 31 monsters in its roster... which isnt bad considering the MAJOR change that MHW is in comparison to the older titles in the series... \n\nbut just for comparison...\n\nlets say monster hunter 4 as a comparison. Not ultimate... just the base game\n\n75\n\nI'm so annoyed that many new players won't see the glory that is the Nerscylla or the Gore Magala. Zinogre or Nargacuga. Gammoth or Rajang... there are SO many more monsters out there and some of them are SO cool/badass that I wish were in the game. \n\nnow I understand that MHW is the \u201cfirst step\u201d in a new line of games so for what they have done. It has been a phenomenal job. But I am seriously hoping for new additions either as DLC or something as time goes on. \n\nBut you can see where my dissapointment lies in terms of content. Especially coming from other MH titles. \n\nOne thing that the PC version does have going for it though.... is mods... I've come from a gamming community where mods have done nothing but improve the current game.... mods from games like Dawn of War, Fallout. Oblivion... etc mods have made some utterly AMAZING content that I feel once those incredibly dedicated and talented people get the hang of it... there is SO much potential for the monster hunter modding community. In time... we could have something truly glorious here. \n\n\n\nAll in all Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game. Even if it is missing some of the content that people that have followed the series are familiar with. In time I feel this could really be an amazing new direction the series is going. \n\nIts first steps have been incredibly impressive so far... now to see where it goes...", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45478088", "timestamp_created": 1540709958, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580099171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3639, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 26564, "steamid": "76561198006485747", "num_reviews": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1540709958, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "This game is so Addicted and so fun", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45466332", "timestamp_created": 1540652631, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1578817421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 12827, "steamid": "76561198813370836", "num_reviews": 52}, "timestamp_updated": 1542953149, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Nice game, one of my favorite.

Lets get started off on the launch which i might add that i didn't get it when it hit the store but heard about the dreaded experiences of friends and other uses about the terrible PC port and it being poorly optimized. Lets not forget that they waited 7ish months to release it to PC, which i kinda question about what the hell were they doing during that time? I personally got the game 2-3 weeks after it dropped on Steam and it still was kinda dog shit, jumping through hoops just to get the damn game running was a tedious and agonizing process of trial and error. My PC is by no means a beast nor is it a 2004 dust filled paper weight, i could run the game, but it was a process of trial and error seeing what settings, drivers, hardware would be greenlit so i could play the game. Something about the game being CPU hungry or crap drivers but i've solved my problem and being able to run it was a blessing. So much hassle to play the game better be worth it..........and guess what? It was.\n\nThe grahics are amazing compared to the previous titles which i was impressed with since i vividly remember the graphics of Monster Hunter 04\". I gotta say capcom has come a long way from Hunter to Freedom to Ultimate to Generations to World. The detail of the monsters and armor is nice but i gotta say this.....the weapon designs are bland as fuck. I'm talking the same fucking weapon model but with different iterations on the weapon, like some have horns, feathers, claws, fur, or different colors from the base tier 1 weapon. I was very dissapointed with this because the past titles had amazing and clever designs in them that people put actual time into. This games weapons designs feel bland and almost no effort put into. The environments are beautiful and well made but i gotta say they messed up on not adding a tundra environment, every past game had one with a plethora of monsters to go with it. \n\nThe game mechanics of World bring many new ideas in the Monster Hunter series such as the Turf Wars, absolutely crazy cool mechanic which i wanted from previous titles. Two Monster trying to protect or invade anothers territory is amazing, just when your fighting a monster and another pops up unexpectedly and you wonder if they'll gank you but instead they start to fight each other is crazy. I would love to see more turf wars between other mosnters as well as this in future games. The riding mechanic is back but with some twists; changing positions on the monster, the monster useing the environment to knock you off, grapling to get back on the monster, its all nice and feels improved. The Grapling is pretty fun to use and helps you get around the biomes faster which is handy, the slinger too is handy in many situations and adds more strategy to the gameplay. On the slinger note the Envrionmental hazards are fun and handy to use in hunts and makes the gameplay feel a little different from previous games. The gathering in this game is different but nice when your running around the map chasing a monster. Say goodbye to some consumable hunter tools your well familiar with and say hello to some permanent tools that you dont have to worry about carring ever again. New hunter tools are welcome and add for some intersting gameplay. Now we get to a point in the game which i absolutly hate......the weapon trees........fuck the weapon trees..having to make the base tier 1 weapons for most of the weapons in the game is one of the stupidest ideas they've come up with, they should've left it as is instead of trying to change it. Another change that pissed me off was the making of charms and the decoration drops. So who ever's bright idea of swithcing this around should be sacked and beat. In previous games you could make decorations which was a breeze instead of the rng of drops to just to get the right fucking decoration to complete your armor set. Charms used to be dropped and they were random with different skills and skill points though they came with their fair share of animosity but it was much easier farming the charms instead of decorations. Now we're at skills......they changed this system too but i don't like it nor do i hate it. It feels like they dumbed it down a bit for the non-monster hunter fans out there. I personally liked the 10+ skill system where you needed 10 points for the skills to activate, new game for a new target audience, main consoles users (Ps4,Xbox1) one thing i also noticed is they removed negative skills.....skills that of course impacted the gamplay against you like slow sharpening, demonic blessing, attack down, blunt edge........no drawbacks to any armor you make which makes the game easier in my opinion. I guess balancing good skills with negative skills is too much for newcomers to MH. And while were at it the skills in this game are ok, a few new skills nothing game breaking and same old same old skills. Now the armor skill sets are awful their nothing new just plain normal skills attached to armor sets, what they should've done is use the armor skill sets from deviant monsters from generations, those weren't normal skills and were unique and nice to have. Another thing i've noticed is baldemaster armor sets and gunner sets are gone only one set to rule them all i guess...\n\nNew World New Monsters. The new monsters in this game are pretty cool but theres so few big monsters to hunt. The big monster roster is around 1/2-2/3 of the previous games. Not many subspecies and not many returning classic monsters like tigrex, nargacuga, zinogre, rajang, lagiacrus. But new game for newcomers so maybe Monster Hunter World Ultimate Generations X will be the biggest with everything. One of the most disappointing things is tempered monsters. Not to be confused with Apex, Frenzied, Deviant, Variants, Sub/Rare species. They're just monsters that hit harder and look metalic. Thats all....no health increases.....no speed increases.......no new move sets.........no literal threat or challenge unless your inept and somehow made it this far yet on luck or being carried. Lets just sweep this under the rug and hopeful never look back at it.\n\nAlright ill wrap this up and say its a good game it just has some flaws that could be fixed if they make a new game. Its not worth 60$, it should be atleast 40$ and at most 50$. I'm an avid Monster Hunter fan so i had to get my hands on it to see what new inovations they came up with. If your new to the series i'd recomend it since its new in its own way even for old MH veterans. For the veterans i'll advise it's mostly up to you.

I've been in love with the franchise since a friend got me to play MH4 Ultimate on the DS. That being said, while I look at this game with rose tinted glasses, I'm not blind to the faults that are here. The most glaring one being the connectivity issues, one minute you're in the middle of a hunt with a friend and the next the game lags out and either you or your friend disconnect and that leaves both you and your friend (one if not both of you) in offline mode fighting a monster that is set to two player difficulty. Which by the way is an awesome function, makes it more challenging when you play with friends. This does still happen from time to time (to me and my friends at least) but not nearly as much thanks to the various patches, so we kinda blame it more on our towns poor excuses for internet providers. Another issue I had was the controls. I'm mostly an mouse and keyboard kinda guy but for some reason it just didn't feel good to me no matter how I customized it. Then when I tried the steam controller everything sorta clicked into place with minimal adjustmens. Meanwhile my earlier mentioned friend is the complete opposite, prefers a controller but when it came to MHW he became a savant with the mouse and keyboard. So take some time to try out the various control methods to figure out what works best for you, cause it is really easy to get frustrated when things don't go well in a hunt. Lastly I gotta talk briefly about the grind, there is deffinately a grind to this game. You'll spend hours hunting a monster to finish an armor set or upgrade a weapon (I swear the game knows when you're aiming for that one specific part) and when you finally finish it, you will have to do it again, I promise you this, but for you completionists it's worth it.\n\nAll that being said though I do absolutely adore this game. The best way I've found to describe this game to people who've never touched a monster hunter game is that its \"pure\". The whole point of the game is to hunt big monsters and use their body parts to make weapons and armor to hunt bigger badder monsters, if you have friends to hunt said monsters with, then bonus! I call it pure because past buying the game inatially there are no pay to win microtransactions. No loot box bullshit, just game. Yeah there is paid for dlc, but that is literally just cosmetic and no gambling to get it, you get what you pay for. That earlier mentioned friend of mine had never touched the monster hunter series before World, he was apprehensive because he felt like it lacked something, and after much prodding I finally got him to try it, and now he's obsessed. My point is don't let any prior misconceptions (or butt hurt reviewers) prevent you from playing this. It's a great game that you can easily loose yourself in. Especially if you're a completionist.\n\nThere, I know a little long winded, but if I can help at least one person decide then I've done my job.

MHW is by far the most playable title Capcom have released, with so many quality of life upgrades that make me wonder why it wasn't always this way. If you're been hesitant to get into this series, now is the time.\n\nCombat has always been the feature in these games, but everything has been taken up a level in World. Each weapon has several new mechanics, and movement has more dynamic options available. It also now has the environments to match, with hidden shortcuts and plenty to climb and swing around on, while still feeling like an organic environment. I can confidently say that all 14 weapon types are fun in their own way, and worth trying out. You're going to be spoilt for options when it comes to playstyle.\n\nUnlike others in the series, this one has modern graphics and doesn't look like it belongs on the PS2. You'll want a beefy computer to run this on its best settings, but if you notch down a few things it will run 1080/60p smoothly on an average graphics card.\n\nIt's fair to say there's a lot of grinding in this game, but the thing is, the grinding is also the core gameplay. You get better each time. Faster, too. Soon you're an expert at taking down that particular monster or using that weapon type. It feels good to accomplish that. If you make a habit of picking items up as you go along on your quests you'll always have what you need to make items and craft equipment. The game teaches you to be resourceful.\n\nThey still have no idea how to tell a story or create interesting characters, so if you're looking for something well written, you can forget about it. I really cringed at a few scenes. This is a game where you set your own goals and write your own narrative.\n\nThey include a mostly good selection of monsters in this title, and overall they're pretty fun to fight. The models look great and their behavior is less robotic. They even have turf wars with each other. Unfortunately the line-up is not as diverse as previous titles. While I have always preferred the more toned-down designs, I wish there were less dragons and more unusual animal types like primates, arachnids, crustaceans, and leviathans found in previous titles. There's literally one water element monster and one ice element monster, but then there's a plethora of fire and blast types. It lacks balance and variety, and the result is some monsters step on eachother's feet to provide player experiences.\n\nLate game is going to feel a bit hollow, too. It doesn't have the breadth of content that other titles in the series can offer. That being said, this is a case of quality over quantity. The main campaign has been fantastic to play, and I still far prefer this new gen experience over everything else I've had with older Monster Hunter titles.\n\nIs this for you? Well, if you want to face-down a dragon, dodge a fireball, run up a wall, jump onto its back, send it to the ground, and lay into it with a giant sword then no other game is going to let you do that as well as Monster Hunter does.\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45302732", "timestamp_created": 1539737497, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580114169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 986, "num_games_owned": 163, "playtime_forever": 19742, "steamid": "76561198032594571", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1539737497, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "I have a strong feeling that this monster hunter game would consume another thousand of hours of my time eventually.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45289914", "timestamp_created": 1539661589, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580115284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4140, "num_games_owned": 500, "playtime_forever": 26653, "steamid": "76561198109578597", "num_reviews": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1539661589, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Keep up the good work!", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45288194", "timestamp_created": 1539647871, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1562534462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 176, "playtime_forever": 15335, "steamid": "76561198024055363", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1539647871, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Kill monsters.

Hands down. I'm not usually one to immediately fall in love with a game, but this one had me at hello. From beautiful gameplay footage, to knowledge and timing based weapons with strengths and weaknesses to the crafting system (arguably the weakest point even then it's mostly that you have to wander around gigantic maps to find little bits of whatever). Some upgrades you have to beat newer higher level monsters. Some monsters have a difficulty that's somewhere between BDSM and a hard place. You'll never walk into an area and steamroll everything. The quest system is, as with everything in this series, not going to hold your hand. Most of the time you have to find your objective unless you've already power levelled your research on that beast. All the weapons you have to figure out the timing to. The tutorials say \"this is the weapon it's heavy/light and leave the rest for you to figure out. The maps are huge and include everything from differences in plant life to vastly different terrain. It seems like a lot of time and effort went into crafting the sheer amount and design of these totally alien (to us) creatures. The animals interacting with the materials around them seems to be non existent, but that's not a deal breaker for me. It would have been nice to kill a monster and find that it was eating an apple or whatever it eats. I have one gripe thats easily fixed. The game was optimized for the use of a controller (especially if you want the insect glaive). So using a keyboard can seriously affect your play. For example sometimes when hitting the 'D' key I would miss and hit 'F' which toggles focus on the different animals you've agroed. It goes from you controlling the camera with your mouse to snapped to that monster from behind you, which is both nauseating and irritating. Like I said this can be fixed by buying a $15 xbox 360 controller. The landscapes are absolutely gorgeous especially compared to the DS ones.

And junior high. It was fun, it was simple. It felt like it was missing something but to me, it was the bees knees. When I heard that this game was coming out and it was way more open world than anything else, I was floored. There was no way this game was going to be able to make that work.\n\nI finally got to play it, and I might have teared up a little when I started. This game is beautiful. I haven't played Monster Hunter for years since my PSP finally died. Freedom Unite, Portable 3rd, Tri, I played all those and missed them dearly, and now I am reliving the dream.\n\nThis game fulfills what I thought was missing from the old games. Its a wide open world with connected areas and stunning biomes. The monsters interact, they have habits and tactics. Everything looks so smooth and pretty (granted, I still play this on low to mid graphics settings just so I can test how well my laptop can actually run this). I have no comments on the multiplayer since my internet isn't strong enough for that kind of stress, but I look forward to trying it out.\n\nEverything you can do in this game is gripping. I haven't gotten bored at all, even with grinding. So far, I have found nothing tedious in this game. \n\nI'm not sure what else to say, its beautiful. My inner teenager is weeping with joy.

This is my first entrance into the Monster Hunter series and suffice as to say, it delivers on a whole lot. This is by no means a perfect game, in fact there are some glaring flaws in terms of gameplay and control optimization, but once when you settle down and get used to everything, there's fun to be had. There's a ton to learn and even more as the game progresses. I feel like the 60 bucks that I spent on this game was well worth the amount of content that I was given. Not to mention the fact that Capcom keeps adding more monsters and other content into the game for FREE! \n\nThere's a lot I want to talk about on every angle of this game on why it's so great that it overwhelms its flaws, however, there's way too much to talk about that when I wrote an original review, I went past the word limit for the review box. I highly recommend this game, however, be warned that this game requires a lot of patience, willingness to learn, and a sound mind. This game isn't easy but it's nowhere near Dark Souls. Speaking of Dark Souls, some Dark Souls players might be familiar with the flow of the combat in this game.  The game WILL punish you and will test your mental stability.\n\nAs for most games, this game is indeed fun with friends, however, there's issues when it comes to social interaction in the game and I believe it still needs some fixing. When entering an instance, the entire hub area is only instanced for yourself while a small room in that hub area serves as a hub for social interaction which makes no sense in a game that should feel more open and robust with life through friends and other gamers alike. There are guild cards which just tells you stats of other people but doesn\u2019t have anything to do with guilds and there feels like less encouragement to actually interact or socialize to make the game a little livelier. However, it\u2019s fun to play with random people who know what they\u2019re doing sometimes and that\u2019s the general quirk of multiplayer for all games, but this one, it gives a unique experience.\n\nAnyway, this game gave me one of the greatest experiences and there\u2019s a whole lot to do. To this day there hasn\u2019t been any loot box nor intrusive microtransactions in the game. The furthest microtransactions go for the game are just mere store costume cosmetics but that\u2019s pretty much it. The updates filled with large content that are coming to the game is FREE. Again, I personally felt like the $60 I spent on this game was most definitely well spent, and I spent nearly 200 hours on this game, and I feel like I haven\u2019t learned about everything this game has to offer. That said, this game is phenomenal and can't wait to see what Iceborne has to offer.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "45222673", "timestamp_created": 1539288229, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580111728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7425, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 35338, "steamid": "76561198045418628", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1574841389, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "The launch was quite bumpy with disconnects and network issue, they fixed this and its great.

To any of you on Steam who have been intimidated by all the bad reviews of this port, your fears are unfounded for the most part. Most of these bad reviews are based on launch day glitches and hang ups that have already been fixed by Capcom and Steam. No, this is not a broken game that's unplayable, not by a long shot. In fact, there are far more positive elements in this game that far outweigh anything negative. \n\nYes, if you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life even this more noob friendly game that walks you through what is required of you a lot more than the older Monster Hunter games is still quite a challenge, but if you take your time to learn the game and hone your hand, eye coordination it is a very enjoyable experience. It is also the most gorgeous looking game graphically than all previous Monster Hunter Games so do make certain you have a computer with the bare minimum GPU or the game will freeze and crash, as it did with my factory standard low end GPU. It is a highly immersive game with it's highly detailed locations that you hunt in right down to the Monster AI which has given the old, returning monsters and the new Monsters more realistic behavioral patterns and movements. There is also a verotable plethora of weapon classes to choose from so that you can find the weapons that are right for your playing style. Just about the only real issue now is the lack of extensive content, but certainly updates in the future will add more quests and more monsters as the consoles have already been updated with more content since they launched earlier in the year. \n\nAll in all this game demands patience, loyalty and dedication for it to be a rewarding experience for you.

But after a day of playing and some google searches its really easy to pick up all the mechanics in the game, nothing hard to learn. There is a bit lack of missions and playerbase if you play from night~ midnight so I do recommend playing it in the morning or afternoon.\n\nThe controls in this game is decent, the default settings for mouse and keyboard aren't the best, but they're easily customizable, so no big deal. \n\n\n\nOverall my experience with the game so far has been a 9/10.\n\nEdit: You should play in borderless window  because in full screen, alt tabbing in the game can make you DC.

Let's begin.\n\nAs a newcomer to MH, I had no idea how this game would turn out to be. As you can see, I have played over 75h already because I loved everything about the game. \n\nAt first I was struggling with the [b] performance [/b] of the game. But thanks to the old NVIDIA drivers, everything got better when I reverted my drivers. If you buy this game and experience FPS issues, try to use the old NVIDIA drivers. I also suggest installing Kaldaien's mod \"Special K\" that can fix ALT-TAB crashes and enable many other options like HDR. I can't promise those 2 solutions will 100% fix those issues if you have them, but it's better than nothing for the moment.\n\nFrom there, everthing was perfect for me. The main [b] complains [/b] of the game at the moment are online issues. It was really bad at first. I used to get disconnected all the time and everyone was in the same situation too. The new patch fortunately fixed the connection issues for me, but a lot of people are still getting disconnected. If you want to buy the game only for the multiplayer, I'd suggest to wait. But if you're more of a solo player, then go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.\n\n[b] The game [/b] itself is fantastic. Like I said, I have poured over 75h in the game already and plan to do the endgame stuff. That's without including the upcoming DLCs, which this game will have many of them. So you could easily spend an infinite amount of time in this game because of the replayability.\n\nThat said, it's a game about [b] grinding and farming [/b]. And the way you grind is to hunt huge creatures/dragons. There are different classes (weapons) to choose to hunt your preys. Each armors/weapon have special skills allocated to them, that way you can make your own builds. Once you finish the first part of the game, you can enhance your gear with jewels, charms and eventually augments. Meaning more grinding, more hunting and more rewards. If you dont like grinding, you will hate this game. But that said, the grinding is rewarding and feels worth it. To me, atleast.\n\nI recommend buying the game.

Since the patch, I have not had a single disconnect and I play this game quite a lot!\n\nIn regards to the people with issues on PC controls.  I have used Xbox, PS3 / 4, and normal PC controls for this game.  They are all extremely fluid and, if I even had any issues with certain PC controls, I was easily able to fix them by changing the keybinds.  Yeah, you can actually do that, believe it or not.\n\nOnto the gameplay:  It's fantastic.  As a long time fan of the series, I have to vouch for this game.  I was initially worried about the apparent PC graphics requirements (blown out of proportion imo) along with the apparent \"hand-holding\" that appeared on the surface.  I'm extremely happy to admit that I was wrong, the gameplay is absolutely amazing and extemely fluid, something that I warmly welcome in contrast to the 3ds control scheme.  Monsters, while not a TON of them, are still fun to fight and rewarding when you defeat them.\n\nWhen it comes to depth, it is still there thankfully.  You can create all kinds of builds with all of the different weapons / armor you can craft.  You could be a Longsword user who relies on empowering their dodge attack, a bow user focused on using an incredibly powerful, Hanzo-ult-esque Dragonpiercer, or even a guy with a Sword and Shield, using the power of Mushrooms and his vast array of potions to buff your allies.  There is TONS of variety, and there are ways to play every weapon for every playstyle.\n\nThe game visually, is stunning.  Just make sure to turn off that annoying fog setting for a sizeable FPS boost, along with a much crisper, cleaner picture.  If you want a nature-walk with the possibility of running into a fire-breathing, popcorn-nose Tyrannosaurus Rex, this is your game.\n\nIf you're worried about not being able to adapt to the depth of the game, or if it is too complex, do not worry.  While the game is helpful in explaining a lot of what the game's inner workings are, there are plenty of other sources online that will explain the more finer details of the game, such as Arrekz Gaming on YouTube.  Sources like these will help you figure out what sort of playstyle you want to go for, and will help explain some more subtle mechanics like Elderseal or the Decorations system.\n\nOverall:  I am very happy with the outcome of this port.  While I was initially annoyed by the server issues at launch, I knew that they would inevitably be fixed.  Now that they are, I'm more than happy to suggest this game to any and all gamers looking for a fun game with plenty of boss fights and outstanding visuals to go with it.  If you're not a fan of grindy games, then this might not be the game for you, though I would sincerely give it a try, as it is even fun beyond the grinding aspect.  Ignore the negative reviews, most of them are whiny and complaining about the now-non-existent server issues or \"Crappy\" keyboard controls that are actually fully customizable.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44357783", "timestamp_created": 1535145582, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580092046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 23680, "steamid": "76561198043943792", "num_reviews": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1535145582, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "20/5 would play every generation", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44357163", "timestamp_created": 1535142960, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1579940681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 32531, "steamid": "76561198140062613", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1535142960, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Played Monster Hunters Tri years ago on the Wii.

From a veteran's standpoint, the new monsters that you can hunt (Anjanath, etc.) makes you relearn new attack patterns (except you Rathalos, you're still a _____), and for newbies, it's really not that hard to get into it and start slashing at monsters' faces. \n\nHOWEVER, one thing I do have to criticize is Multiplayer.\n\nThe core element of MH is to fight monsters WITH ALLIES.

Monster Hunter, on PC.\nThey went a step further with a lot of quality of life changes from previous versions.\nThere are ~6 large and diverse maps on which you will hunt, and there are no more area transitions on maps, maps are a single complete map. This may sounds like strange praise for people who hadn't had any experience with the franchise before, but it is a huge change. \n\nThe attacks are fairly slow and deliberate, so the game praises learning and reading the monsters for windows to attack, rather than spamming attacks. \n\nThere are 14 weapons available to choose from. All with their own Pros, Cons and playstyles. All 14  weapons feel different, and all of them are viable. There are no attacks or techniques locked behind an XP or skill tree grind.

Connectivity issues have been corrected, new content is forthcoming, and things are coming along smoothly. I'm sad it took the better part of a month after release to correct it, a month with saw all of my friends beating the game independent of each other, but at least we can finally join up and enjoy things now.\n\nHaving that said, this is a gorgeous game with a widely-varied and well-balanced cadre of amazing weapons, all of which have their own play style and functions in combat. Items are meaningful and managing your resources mid-combat is both challenging and easy to do, with a control system that is tight and easy to understand. The game doesn't explain every mechanic to you, so at least some of the game is going to require experimentation and discovery, which can be daunting when you consider how much you have to hunt to get some items. However, going by the console release, there's only more amazing things on the horizon with MHW, and I'm sure you will love it. \n\nJust bear in mind that the \"tutorial\" is going to last you the entire length of your refund window, if you have any reservations. Just saying.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nI'm going to preserve my (750+ helpful rating) previous review here, for posterity, and to encourage Capcom to think twice before releasing a game in this state again:\n\nI've purchased this game twice. I bought it for PS4, and fell in love with it. There were little disconnects here and there, but I assumed that was an issue with the stability of the console and my wi-fi internet. For months, I enthusiastically sold the game to my friends on the promise of that fun, and when they agreed to purchase it for the PC, I was ecstatic, because it meant I'd get to share it with them.\n\nI bought a second copy for PC, so I could join them on their adventure. We joked around about the unskippable cutscenes and the mandatory, slow tutorial. I listened as they plowed through the first missions, so they could get to the point where the game started letting them team up together and, when we all finally got together for our first group hunt, we endeavored to launch a mission as a squad.\n\nOh, wait, squads don't exist on PC. You have to fuck around with Steam Groups. Finally got that figured out? Bam, disconnect. Restart the mission. Bam, error code 503820-MW1, gotta rejoin a public session with my friends. Wait, now your friend hosting the session isn't showing on the \"friends' sessions\" list. Gotta restart the session. Someone still isn't seeing it, have them host instead. Their game crashed, everyone loads back in, finally groups up, and launches the mission. Bam, another disconnect. And another. And another. And another. And another.\n\nI'm 54 hours into this game over the last two weeks and I've finished less than a half-dozen hunts with my friends. Most of the time, everyone gets kicked out of the session, and you have to finish the battle alone against a monster that has scaled up to 140% extra health vs 4 players. Lag, disconnects on a wired connection, hosting issues, and networking problems galore have plagued me since buying this title on PC. I've disconnected more times in two weeks on PC than I ever did in 8 months of PS4 gameplay. Several of my friends have beaten the game by themselves, and are waiting for the game to be fixed so we can do something, ANYTHING, together. And to think... Capcom took an additional 8 months to release on PC because they wanted to ensure the game was \"optimized and delivered in it's best possible version.\"\n\nMonster Hunter World is a brilliant game, when it works, but it is marred by constant and persistent stability issues, time-wasting unskippable cutscenes and credit sequences, occasionally unfair monster behavior (Pink Rathian perma-charging and Kirin lightning RDM, I'm looking RIGHT at you), and an absolutely horseshit amount of networking errors that have yet to be resolved after 8 months of preparation and two weeks of the game being released. Toss in Denuvo DRM (seriously, FUCK DRM), issues with Big Picture/Steam Overlay that almost require you to DISABLE TWO CORE COMPONENTS OF STEAM in the platform settings, and the fact that Capcom has only issued a blanket statement about \"investigating the issues\" with no follow-up over the last few weeks, and you have a recipe for an avalanche of continuing problems with no time frame for correction.\n\nI'll change this review later if it's fixed, *maybe*... but for now, give this game a pass.

Although the pace of updates isn't exactly fast, the multiplayer and mouse issues have been fixed. As such, I'm changing this review to positive and I can recommend this game. However, everything isn't perfect yet. The keyboard support still isn't superb with some inconvenient and unchangeable keybinds. Some of the graphics bugs were fixed but there is still room for improvement. \n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n\nI'm conflicted. Monster Hunter: World is a great game. I haven't been this addicted to a video game in years. In fact, it's so good that I actually wake up early to squeeze in a few hunts before going to work. I've clocked in over 100 hours since the game was released 2 weeks ago. That's roughly 8 hours of monster hunting per day. \n\nI want to recommend this game so more people can experience the fun but I ultimately can't recommend a game that is currently broken. I wish I could write a review about the fun core gameplay or the poorly designed elements but all those aspects of the game are completely overshadowed by the huge issues in this port so let's talk about those instead.\n\n[h1]Mouse & Keyboard Support[/h1]\n\nIt's clear that the game devs haven't played many PC games and it feels like they did the bare minimum to be able to say they support mice and keyboards. It's rare for a console port to perfectly implement mouse input but I've never seen anything quite as bad as the mouse input in Monster Hunter: World. Your mouse emulates a controller joystick. That means that you get a max turn speed, input lag, and dead zones (i.e. small movements aren't recognized). The default keyboard keybinds are also pretty weird and because of how control schemes were designed with a controller in mind, it can't be fixed with re-binding. Using something from the radial menu takes 3 clicks when in any other PC game, it would be accessible on a hotbar with a single click. Using a mouse and keyboard felt so uncomfortable that I, a competitive FPS player, ultimately decided to play this game with a controller. \n\n[h1]Graphics and Optimization[/h1]\n\nThe game looks pretty good but it's poorly optimized. I generally get 60+ FPS on high with a GTX 1070 and i7-6700k but certain maps and effects cause micro-stuttering and FPS drops to the 40s. Many quality settings are outright broken. The game still loads in low res textures regardless of the texture setting. Water reflections and shadows aren't rendered. It's a pity. If this game was well optimized and had high resolution textures, it could be beautiful on the PC.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n\nWhen multiplayer works, the game is at its best. Hunting together with friends is unbelievably fun but the servers are unstable right now. Sometimes I'll play for hours with only a disconnect or two but othertimes I disconnect so frequently that it's impossible to complete a hunt online. Server stability issues aside, I believe that the core design of multiplayer in this game should be re-designed. You can only see other hunters in your session inside of a specific area of town or on hunts. The whole online session thing feels very dated. If I want to hunt with 3 friends, I have to create an online session, invite the 3 friends to join my online session, post a quest, and get my friends to join said quest. Diablo 3 came out 6 years ago and its multiplayer design feels more modern than Monster Hunter's.\n\nIf you're willing to live with these issues, the game can be incredibly fun, challenging, and rewarding but players shouldn't have to put up with these problems in the first place. Fixing the aforementioned issues wouldn't result in a perfect game but it would result in a game that I could wholeheartedly recommend to my friends.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44320927", "timestamp_created": 1534977962, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1537736599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 376, "playtime_forever": 12924, "steamid": "76561197996318341", "num_reviews": 4}, "timestamp_updated": 1537734427, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u73af\u5883\u95f4\u7ea0\u7ed3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765......\u7b97\u4e86\u6295\u4e2a\u5e74\u5ea6\u6700\u4f73\u5427", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44320221", "timestamp_created": 1534974558, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580106975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3914, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 39427, "steamid": "76561198287474539", "num_reviews": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1542957801, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Having a lot of connections issues but the game play is solid.

Now, I played on console (Xbox to be exact) and love the game but due to not paying for Xbox Gold I couldn't play with others. On top of that my friends owned Playstations so I couldn't play with my friends which just gave me more reason to repurchase the game. For the most part the game is the same exact game that the console launch had.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of people complaining about no DLCs such as Deviljho and Behemoth, but it was announced a month or two before release that they would be released on a later date. I feel like people hating on this game for that reason should've just read the news closer/more. The dev team said that due to their lack of knowledge in working with PC releases they would not be releasing any DLCs on time.\n\nI also see a lot of people complaining about optimization issues. I'm using an Intel I5 Processor and an Nvidia 1060 and have 0 problems running this game 60 FPS. The only time I ever had issues was in Full Screen and alt + tabing out of the game with a controller plugged in I found it would consistently crash my game. This was easily fixed by switching to Borderless Windowed.\n\nThe network issues has already been addressed by the dev team and they are currently working on a fix, though as they said, they do NOT have experience making games for PC so it may take time. I also did some expirementing and found out a couple things about the issues. If you're playing with friends and someone leaves the session for any reason, the game thinks the session has ended and nobody else can join the session meaning if you aren't already in the session you cannot join. I've also noticed an issue with a friend's computer (who has very much higher specs than me) in having issues with Steam connection, sort of. It will consistently boot him offline then online again but doesn't create any issues in game besides not being able to host. My recommendation is find a suitable host out of your friends and then don't leave the game if you plan on coming back soon. Users should also note that the console launch had these launch bugs with network issues as well.\n\nThe only other issue I've really noticed is the game will randomly hit me even though I'm blocking on gunlance. This is rather rare and random, but it does happen and really isn't an issue.\n\nI do highly recommend this game, but please keep in mind that you do need a mid tier computer at least to run a smooth 60 FPS. This game has launch bugs like every game has but is definitely worth the $60 asking price. If you were looking to play the DLC monsters right away, I would recommend either buying the game and prepping yourself for those fights or waiting to purchase the game until after those DLCs are released.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44319558", "timestamp_created": 1534971431, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580117851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 632, "num_games_owned": 515, "playtime_forever": 11799, "steamid": "76561198066224772", "num_reviews": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1534971431, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Love the game but fix your shit and quit being such a lousy company, Capcom.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44318995", "timestamp_created": 1534969264, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1555041265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 20643, "steamid": "76561198023827267", "num_reviews": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1534969264, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "This game is amazing I'll start with that, but as of this version of the game there are issues, like low resolution textures and online issues other then that the core game is great. \n\nAll issues I can see being addressed some time or and another.

And, as such, MHW is my first MH game. I've seen a few long time fans of the MH franchise complain about afew things, but what they point out largely just doesn't bug me. The situation reminds me of the Gothic games. I loved Gothic, but it was a broken and half unplayable pile of garbage. Which I stress that I loved enough to suffer through many times. ELEX is the latest game by the same folks. It's different, but you won't catch me complaining about more freedom of movement in combat, less BS to swim through for unlocking armors, or large amounts of magic-like abilities being tied to literally ONE faction.\n\nSo with \"MH Casual\" branded upon my forehead, let us Sally forth.\n\nThe Monsters: Each monster feels unique. Not just LOOKS unique. Feels. They fight in an intelligent way that is unique to morphology. Sure, there are shared telegraphs and moves, but an Odogarron's fanged lunge has a different arc and follow-up than a Tobi-Kadachi's, Great Girros', or Great Jaggras'. Word on the 'net is that MH:W doesn't boast a huge enough amount of Monsters. Well... I've played for 40+ hours easily, and I'm pretty sure I've only punched about half the Monsters in the face. That's not to say that progression is slow, there's just a lot of mobs to pwn. And you'll want to pwn them serveral times.\n\nThe Hunters: omfg. There are a lot of armors and weapons. Type wise, there's more than enough to choose from. Heck, I'm picky and I still found a melee weapon and a ranged weapon that I liked the feel of. It's important to know that you're not really meant to make EVERY low rank armor or have the perfect set of skills for all of low rank. But you are expected to fill out the weapon trees of the ones you like, since they bleed into the higher rank gear. MH vets, think of it as the remedial course to get us 'casuals' up to speed and worried about skill choices. Also, the progression of HR armors is a bit flattened; Leather Armor Alpha/Beta gives 32 armor a piece, and most others give 40-50. 20 armor IS a deal, but it's also not the end of the world if you really like the skill an armot peice gives. It's certainly not 2 vs 32, in any case. There's outliers with 70 armor a piece, but high rank frees you up to get the skills you want without being comically underpowered.\n\nThe World: MH:W is GORGEOUS and worth exploring. Everything helps you out. Everything. Gather everything. Fish everything. ... Or don't. It's mostly just convinent craftables or points, and you can get mostly everything some alternative way. Monsters feel like they belong where they are. But...\n\nThe Technical: MH:W is one greedy SOB. It will take all the CPU you can give it... And ask for more. You need one monster of a rig to get this game running at 60 FPS. Even then, you might have troubles with your nVidia 10 series graphics cards. I'm talking 12 FPS in the rotten vale problems. I solved my woes by installing a previous version of the drivers. I'm not blaming MHW or nVidia on this one, but it WILL impact your experience negatively if you are unaware of it. Denuvo is still as anti-consumer as ever, and if that is a deal breaker I want you to know I feel for you; I've not played a Ubisoft game since Assassin's Creed 2. Sometimes having principles on a thing can suck a little. \n\nThe Play Time: perhaps my favorite thing about MH:W is that 20-30 minutes is a full experience, without needing to rush it. So many games faff you about in a way you never actually accomplish anything. MH:W definitely gives you a full experience in 30 minutes. You prep, anticipate what you want, follow the monster, fight it in a epic battle, then go home. You put stuff away, check on the things you care about, and then you're ready to prep again. It makes for excellent pacing.\n\nI hope you enjoy MH:W as much as I do. Just... Be warey that it's not joking around on the CPU reqs, and you may have to live with 30FPS if that's all you can do.", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44315065", "timestamp_created": 1534953784, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1575137429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_forever": 21640, "steamid": "76561198086905934", "num_reviews": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1534953784, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "First of all, sorry for my bad english but i am not a nativ speaker, i decided to write this in english so more poeple can actualy read it.\n\nMonster Hunter World...\n\nThe game with huge delay for the PC release..\nThe game with connection issues that are realy anyoing..\nThe game if such a stupid story, mediocre charackters and bad dialog...\n\nwell is this going to be another negativ hat driven review froma dissapointed person that wanted to play coop but cant?\n\nNo its not!\nI actualy fel in love with this game!\nCombat feels unbeleavably good!

I cant understand the tendecie of some people to allways jump on the hate train instead of thinking for them selfes or trying to see the good in something instead of picking on whats bad....\nIts realy said that the PC community ( no just this game) is such a toxic mess.\n\nBut this is supposed to be a review.\n\nI can absolutley recomment this game to any one who enjoys Souls Games, Games like DMC or even action RPGs like Diablo.\n\nU like intense combat and getting loot for it, well this game is for you.\n\nDont expect good story telling or clever dialog and you should have a controler, then this is one of the most wonderfull games to waste your time on in 2018!\n\ndont listen to the negative trolls, they will allways be there.\n\nI realy hope this wont be the last PC release for Monster Hunter, \nand since i have allready repeated my self a couple of times... its time for me to go hunt!\n\nSo.. Happy Hunting for all of you! and thumbs up to CAPCOM for this beatiful game that was not made to maximize comercial income, but for the Players! Thanks for that (and thx in advance for fixing the connection issue :) )\n\n\n", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "44315049", "timestamp_created": 1534953749, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1548029761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 14796, "steamid": "76561197985487543", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1534953749, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "I don't usually write reviews but looking at the steam page is madness.\n\n40% of the of reviewers rated this positive is absolutely asinine. \n\nThis is my first real Monster Hunter title so I am biased in that regard.

While there are tons of reports for various issues like multiplayer connection issues, corrupted saves (which was proven false), to optimization, this game surely is a diamond in the rough. If you have never played the series like myself, I will tell you right now to purchase this game. The way this game continues to throw challenges and expresses the way the monsters interact with their environment and hierarchy of monsters is constantly mind blowing for a video game. You can see the personality of every monster. This is truly one of the best games I have played in quite a while, and im not just fanboying Capcom. With all that said, it does face some issues that are glaring. It has the same graphics as the console and struggles to do this well, on my high end rig in struggle to keep a stead frame rate, but after a few roll backs on drivers and messing with settings, this can be over looked, the port isn't THAT bad. The game clearly has playing on a controller in mind from the get go, the mouse and k/b functions are a little sloppy, but they said they are working on getting this more fine tuned. There is one other major issue that a lot of the community cannot get past though, and that is the multiplayer. There are a slew of disconnects constantly happening for people, I see friends constantly logging in and out of MHW. While I personally do not have any issues staying connected or finding people to play with, ever, this is a big issue for some people. BUT DO NOT WORRY, unlike most of the people who see this as a major issue, if you have a bit of patience and wait it out, Capcom ARE trying to get a fix for this out, and you can see their logs proving so. While they have remained quiet about the issue, this cannot be seen as a bad thing. Who wants to come to their community and keep telling them they still have no fixed the issue, they will come to us when they are ready.\n\n\nAll in all, I think this game is truly worth experiencing for the first time. It has challenges, and hell, for all these people complaining about the multiplayer. Go play the game solo and actually enjoy what you have for the time being, and then enjoy the game with friends once the issue is resolved. I know the game wasn't sold off as a single player game, but it is a GREAT game to play solo OR with friends. If the MP issues concern you, I would wait it out and continue to follow the news about the game. But don't let any others deter you, because people are much more vocal about issues over complements. \n\n\nTo Capcom, The people who enjoy the game do not care how long it takes for the game to fixed, do the job right and fix your rep with one good patch.

Though i ended up disappointed. the mutiplayer would almost never work and i spent most of my time in Solo, i ended up droping this game alot faster then i had hoped on console.\n\nSoon enough i got myself a new good gaming PC and ended up getting hyped again for this game on PC and here are my thoughts.\n\nMonster hunter world overall is probly the best Monster hunter yet. The game improves countless things over the other monster hunters and overall makes it easier to get into for newcomers.\n\nThe game has a huge emphasis on its story, something the other games lacked and honestly, I did not care at all for the story or any of the characters i met. Though i did enjoy some of the cutsceens that played when meeting a monster for the first time. Though i wish i could skip some of the cutsceens, since i was playing though a second time.\n\nAs someone who has played since Monster hunter 3 TRI on Wii Seeing monster hunter with this level of graphics is stunning. everything feels so alive, you can see and catch all sorts of tiny creatures within the world giving the world a extra feel of life. This game really benifets being on Pc and newer consoles One of the biggest changes in this game is the map being one huge area instead of being small areas put together by load screens this adds so much to the world feeling more real and alive in so many ways\n\nThe game brings many qulity of life changes that all come together to make the best Monster hunter experience such as not having to stop to pick up items such as herbs or honey which made me want to grab stuff now. Being able to see where items spawned on your map, so even if you dont have any honey you could easily know where stuff is. being able to move well drinking potions, having a wishlist for armor that tells you if you get a resorse you needed for that shiny new armor you wanted to craft and so on. There is so much stuff that i dont think i could list all the improvements, but just know it really pulls together the experience.\n\nFor anyone who has been looking into this series for awile now but was never able to get into it i highly recommend it to you.\n[9/10]", "voted_up": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "44306460", "timestamp_created": 1534916852, "steam_purchase": true, "author": {"last_played": 1580008197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1767, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 5593, "steamid": "76561198153120744", "num_reviews": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1534916852, "written_during_early_access": false, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english"}, {"comment_count": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "review": "Beautiful game with in-depth weapon and armor trees, large-ish world to explore, and very very fun bosses to fight.

There are so many small improvements they've made over the years to streamline certain aspects of the game. But, [b]Monster Hunter Worlds [/b] takes all those older QOL updates and makes them look sad compared to itself.

Actual Storyline intergrated into the game\n2. New selection of monsters to fight\n3. Smooth and percise gameplay\n4. Those amazing graphics\n5. Scoutflies are amazing and super helpful\n6. I love monster hunter and everything about it?\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n1. Only encountered it twice personally, but there are known disconnect issues currently going on. I'm sure Capcom will have them fixed within the coming weeks, so no need to worry there.\n\n2. There is also a bug in the game where there is a chance to lose your entire save file after defeating the final boss. There are work arounds though, including saving your MHW save file to a seperate folder prior to your battle with the final boss just in case.\n\n3. As much as there are new monsters, the roster of overall creatures is surprising low sitting at around 30.
